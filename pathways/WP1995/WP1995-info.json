    "description": "Nitric oxide (NO) is an important signaling molecule with vasodilatory and anti-inflammatory effects, indicating a positive role in reducing hypertension and cardiovascular disease. At the same time, NO is also associated with health risks such as increased risk in carcinogenesis, and hypoxia in infants. It has been suggested that NO can also increase mitochondrial efficiency. NO can be formed from L-Arginine through the classic arginine-NO-synthase pathway, or it can be formed directly from dietary nitrite by deoxygenated globins.",
