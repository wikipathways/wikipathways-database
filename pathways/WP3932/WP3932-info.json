    "description": "Cell-matrix adhesions play important roles in biological processes such as cell motility, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, regulation of gene expression and cell survival. Focal adhesions are structures formed at the cell-extracellular matrix contact points, consisting of bundles of actin filaments anchored to trans-membrane receptors of the integrin family through a complex of multiple proteins. In addition to participating in the structural link between membrane receptors and the actin cytoskeleton, focal adhesions also contain signaling molecules, such as protein kinases and phosphatases, their substrates, and various adapter proteins. Integrin signaling is dependent on the non-receptor tyrosine kinase activities of the FAK and src proteins and the adaptor protein functions of FAK, src and Shc to initiate downstream signaling events. These signaling events results in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, which is essential for changes in cell shape and motility, and gene expression.   Source: [KEGG](https://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?pathway+map04510).  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3932).",
