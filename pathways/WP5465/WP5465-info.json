    "description": "The Fanconi anemia pathway is a biochemical network that helps repair DNA, replicate DNA, and perform other cellular functions. The pathway's main function is to remove DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs), which are barriers that can prevent DNA replication and genetic transcription. The Fanconi anemia pathway uses components from other DNA repair processes, including: Homologous recombination (HR), Nucleotide excision repair (NER), and Translesion synthesis (TLS). The pathway also helps stabilize replication forks and regulate cytokinesis.",
