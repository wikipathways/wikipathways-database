    "description": "The paper (1) describes insulin signalling in human adipocytes under normal and diabetic states using mathematical models based on experimental data. This model corresponds to insulin signalling under normal conditions. Insulin signalling under diabetic condition is represented in WP3635. The model has been converted to GPML using the PathSBML plugin from PathVIsio, importing the model BIOMD0000000448 from the BioModels Database directly. The layout has been improved manually.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3634).",
