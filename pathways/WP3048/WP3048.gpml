    <Comment Source="Reactome">This event has been computationally inferred from an event that has been demonstrated in another species.&lt;p&gt;The inference is based on the homology mapping in Ensembl Compara. Briefly, reactions for which all involved PhysicalEntities (in input, output and catalyst) have a mapped orthologue/paralogue (for complexes at least 75% of components must have a mapping) are inferred to the other species. High level events are also inferred for these events to allow for easier navigation.&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='/electronic_inference_compara.html' target = 'NEW'&gt;More details and caveats of the event inference in Reactome.&lt;/a&gt; For details on the Ensembl Compara system see also: &lt;a href='http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/compara/homology_method.html' target='NEW'&gt;Gene orthology/paralogy prediction method.&lt;/a&gt;</Comment>
