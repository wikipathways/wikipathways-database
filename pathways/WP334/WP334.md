description: This pathway was created using the GPCRDB (Horn et al., 1998), http://www.gpcr.org/7tm/
  (originally at http://www.cmbi.kun.nl/7tm/). The groupings are based on the GPCR
  phylogenetic tree available from the GPCRDB and the training sets used by Karchin
  et al. (Bioinformatics, 2002, pg. 147-159). The labels indicate children and grandchildren
  of the various classes of GPCRs as described by these references.
