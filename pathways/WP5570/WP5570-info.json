    "description": "This Pathway is a schematic representation of Glycerol metabolism, which is an important intermediate metabolite, acting as a bridge between carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. This pathway also depicts inherited metabolic diseases that disrupt glycerol metabolism including: Glycerol kinase deficiency, Glycerate kinase deficiency, Aquaporin 7 deficiency and Cytosolic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. This pathway was inspired by chapter 49 (Disorders of Glycerol Metabolism) of the book of Blau (ISBN 978-3-030-67726-8).",
