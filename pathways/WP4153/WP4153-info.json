    "description": "The degradation of SphingoLipids (SLs) occurs through a series of specific hydrolases in the lysosome, after the compounds have been transported via the endosomal pathway. Disorders resulting from an enzyme defect are highlighted in pink. Hydrolase defects result in accumulation and lysosomal storage of substrates, leading to cell pathology.  This pathway was inspired by Edition 5, Chapter 60 of the book of Blau (ISBN 9783030677268); Ed.4 Ch.25.   Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP4153).",
