    "description": "Coagulation is a complex process by which blood forms clots. It is an important part of hemostasis (the cessation of blood loss from a damaged vessel), wherein a damaged blood vessel wall is covered by a platelet and fibrin-containing clot to stop bleeding and begin repair of the damaged vessel. Disorders of coagulation can lead to an increased risk of bleeding (hemorrhage) or clotting (thrombosis).  Source: [[wikipedia:Coagulation|Wikipedia]]  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP272 CPTAC Assay Portal]",
