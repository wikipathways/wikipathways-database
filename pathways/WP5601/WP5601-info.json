    "description": "In vascular smooth muscle, caffeine promotes relaxation by inhibiting myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK) through cAMP elevation and activating myosin light-chain phosphatase (MLCP), reducing myosin\u2013actin interaction.  As a nonselective adenosine receptor antagonist, caffeine blocks A\u2081/A\u2083 receptors (which normally lower cAMP) and A\u2082A/A\u2082B receptors (which normally raise cAMP), thereby altering adenylate cyclase activity.  In endothelial cells, caffeine increases intracellular Ca²\u207a, activating eNOS to produce nitric oxide (NO), which diffuses to smooth muscle and stimulates cGMP signaling, further promoting vasodilation.
