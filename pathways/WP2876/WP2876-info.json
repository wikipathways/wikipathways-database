    "description": "The Pregnane X receptor (PXR, a.k.a. NR1I2) is a nuclear receptor whose primary function is sensing xenobiotics. It regulates the gene expression of genes that encode proteins involved in detoxification and clearance of xenobiotics.    Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2876 CPTAC Assay Portal]",
