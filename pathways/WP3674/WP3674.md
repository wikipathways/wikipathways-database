description: Mutations in the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) gene result in HPE in humans and
  mice, and the Shh pathway is targeted by other mutations that cause holoprosencephaly
  (HPE). HPE is a severe human genetic disease affecting craniofacial development
  of children.  The TGIF1 gene maps to the HPE4, and the heterozygous loss of the
  TGIF1 mutations are associated with HPE, however mouse models have yet to explain
  how the inhibition of TGIF causes the genetic disease Holoprosencephaly.  Using
  a conditional Tgif1 allele, Taniguchi, et al. showed that mouse embryos lacking
  both Tgif1 and the related Tgif2 have HPE-like phenotypes reminiscent of Shh null
  embryos.
