    "description": "Proposed signaling pathways by which MFAP5 induces LPP expression and increases the permeability and motility of endothelial cells via cytoskeleton rearrangement. The activation of the MFAP5-mediated signaling cascade in endothelial cells up-regulates LPP expression and subsequently promotes the motility of endothelial cells and the permeability of the endothelial cell monolayer.   Adapted from supplemental figure 11 from [Leung et al](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5785271/).",
