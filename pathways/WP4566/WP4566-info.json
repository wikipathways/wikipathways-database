    "description": "Chronic stimulation of the PDGFRA receptor results in decreased phosphorylation of RSK1/2 and S6K1/2, which subsequently impairs the phosphorylation of S6 ribosome protein and associated ribosome biogenesis and 5\u2032 TOP mRNA translation. The phosphorylation of 4EBP1 and PDCD4 are suppressed, which subsequently limits the components of the eIF4F complex (eIF4E and eIF4A) from joining into the complex. In addition, the phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF4B is also decreased. These changes result in a suppressed CAP-dependent translation initiation in cells with chronic stimulated PDGFRA signaling compared with acute stimulated ones.  Based on figure S7 from [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6238596/ Zhou et al].",
