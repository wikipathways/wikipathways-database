Dotted conversions are hypothetical, either not occurring or undocumented (Sphingomap details all possible permutations of a pathway to the final glycolipid) Numbers are the sphingomap IDs, to be converted. Metabolites coloured red are not yet in LIPIDMAPS  Metabolites with a dotted box are hypothetical. These may or may not exist on the pathway to the final product as several different routes could occur.",
