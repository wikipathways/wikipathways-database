    "description": "Isoglobo pathway in its entirety from [SphinGOMAP](https://www.lipidmaps.org/resources/sphingomap).  Solid conversion arrows are documented according to Sphingomap.  Dotted conversions are hypothetical, either not occurring or undocumented (Sphingomap details all possible permutations of a pathway to the final glycolipid).  Numbers represent the sphingomap IDs, to be converted. Metabolites coloured red are not yet in LIPIDMAPS  Metabolites with a dotted box are hypothetical. These may or may not exist on the pathway to the final product as several different routes could occur.",
