    "description": "Biotransformation is the chemical modification (or modifications) made by an organism on a chemical compound. If this modification ends in mineral compounds like CO2, NH4+, or H2O, the biotransformation is called mineralisation.  Biotransformation means chemical alteration of chemicals such as nutrients, amino acids, toxins, and drugs in the body. It is also needed to render non-polar compounds polar so that they are not reabsorbed in renal tubules and are excreted. Biotransformation of xenobiotics can dominate toxicokinetics and the metabolites may reach higher concentrations in organisms than their parent compounds. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotransformation]  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP702 CPTAC Assay Portal]",
