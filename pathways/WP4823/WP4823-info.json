    "description": "Kidneys develop from intermediate mesoderm under the timed or sequential control of a growing number of genes. These genes have been identified at various stages of glomerulotubular development in the mammalian kidney. The genes listed have been tested in various genetically modified mice, and their location corresponds to the classical stages of kidney development postulated by Saxen in 1987.",
