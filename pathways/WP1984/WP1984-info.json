    "description": "This pathway incorporates the most important proteins for breast cancer. The Rp score from the Connectivity-Maps (C-Maps) webserver was used to determine the rank of the most important proteins in breast cancer. These proteins were then used to determine the most important pathways involved in breast cancer by using the Human Pathway Database (HPD). The pathways retrieved from the Human Pathway Database were from several sources such as Protein Lounge, BioCarta, KEGG, and NCI-Nature. The pathways were then annotated. Protein-protein relations for the most important proteins for breast cancer were determined by annotating the pathways and by literature review. The protein-protein interactions are mapped onto this pathway.   Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP1984).",
