Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOPs), in general, are defined as a sequence of key events that begins with a molecular initiating event (MIE) and leads to an Adverse Outcome. At that level, AOPs are described in the [AOPWiki](https://aopwiki.org/). This AOP network is based on 3 AOPs: [AOPwiki:3](https://aopwiki.org/aops/3), [AOPwiki:273](https://aopwiki.org/aops/273) and [AOPwiki:276](https://aopwiki.org/aops/276).",
