    "description": "This pathway displays current genes, proteolytic events and other processes associated with the progression of Alzheimer's disease. Note: mitochondrial associated genes Cx I through Cx V are not currently included, as these correspond to over a hundred distinct factors. See below source URL for more information.   Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2059)",
