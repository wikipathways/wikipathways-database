    "description": "S. cerevisiae synthesizes the essential amino acid L-lysine via the L-alpha-aminoadipic acid pathway instead of the diaminopmelate pathway (CITS: [10714900]).  Originally proposed to be characteristic of fungi, recent studies suggest prokaryotes also synthesize lysine via the alpha-aminoadipic acid pathway (CITS: [11029074]). Intermediates in this pathway are often incorporated into secondary metabolites.  For example, it has been well- studied that alpha-aminoadipate is required for penicillin production (CITS: [10714900]).    Regulation of the lysine biosynthetic pathway in S. cerevisiae is an interaction between general amino acid control (via Gcn4p) (CITS: [Hinnebusch]), feedback inhibition of homocitrate synthase activity by lysine (CITS: [10103047]), and induction of Lys14p by alpha-aminoadipate semialdehyde (CITS: [10975256]).
