    "description": "Simplified PDGFR-beta pathway, based on figure 7B from [Zhang et al](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27372738).   Platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR) are cell surface tyrosine kinase receptors for members of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) family. PDGF subunits -A and -B are important factors regulating cell proliferation, cellular differentiation, cell growth, development and many diseases including cancer. There are two forms of the PDGFR, alpha and beta each encoded by a different gene. Depending on which growth factor is bound, PDGFR homo- or heterodimerizes.  Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet-derived_growth_factor_receptor) Protein phosphorylation sites were added based on information from PhosphoSitePlus (R), www.phosphosite.org.",
