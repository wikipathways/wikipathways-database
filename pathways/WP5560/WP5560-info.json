    "description": "Therapeutic approaches in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) increasingly focus on modulating B and T cell activity.  B cell\u2013directed therapies involve targeting specific surface receptors such as CD19, CD20, CD22, CD38, and CD40, as well as blocking B cell-related cytokines like BAFF (B-cell activating factor, also known as TNFSF13B).  T cell-focused strategies include blocking co-stimulatory pathways (e.g. CD40\u2013CD40L, CD80/86\u2013CD28, ICOS\u2013ICOSL) and inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, IL-12, IL-17, IL-23, and IFN-Î³.
