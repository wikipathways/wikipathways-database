    "description": "Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a critical part of the innate immune response, and are expressed on macrophages and dendritic cells. TLRs are pattern-recognition receptors, and recognize molecules derived from microbes. Once activated, TLRs result in activation of innate immunity by inducing production of proinflammatory cytokines and upregulation of costimulatory molecules",
