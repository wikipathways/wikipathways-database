    "description": "Latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) of the Ebstein-Barr Virus (EBV) elicits its oncogenic effects through the activation of several downstream pathways such as Pi3K/akt, IRF4, and NFkB pathways.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP262)",
