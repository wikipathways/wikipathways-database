    "description": "This pathway shows copper metabolism and translocation for two cell types (enterocytes and hepatocytes), as well as associated disorders for transportation of copper to vesicles. Copper is an essential trace element required for the functioning of metalloenzymes. Copper is ingested through diet, absorbed by enterocytes in the intestinal walls, and sent to hepatocytes via the hepatic portal system.   This pathway model was constructed using chapter 39 of the book \"Physician's Guide to the Diagnosis, Treatment, and Follow-Up of Inherited Metabolic Diseases (first edition)\" by Blau (ISBN 3642403360)",
