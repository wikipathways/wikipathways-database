    "description": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as significant players in colorectal cancer pathogenesis. This pathway represents a review of long non-coding RNA (LncRNA) involvement in canonical Wnt signaling as it relates to colorectal cancer.   The pathway is adapted from [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5618652/ Shen et al] . Phosphorylation sites were added based on information from PhosphoSitePlus (R), www.phosphosite.org.",
