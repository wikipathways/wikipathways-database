    "description": "This pathways describes the biosynthesis of N-linked (Asparagine-linked) glycans, to form glycoproteins. This process is a type of co-translational and post-translational modification and sometimes referred to as N-linked glycosylation. Glycosylation is important for many processes, including  protein folding and cell-cell adhesion and immune function.  This pathway was modeled based on Figure 9.3 and 9.4 from [Essentials of Glycobiology [Internet]. 3rd edition](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK453020/), Figure 17.1 from [Dall'Olio](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-13-2835-0_17) and [KEGG]9https://www.genome.jp/pathway/hsa005100.",
