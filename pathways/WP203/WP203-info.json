    "description": "Purine nucleotides participate in many aspects of cellular metabolism including the structure of DNA and RNA, serving as enzyme cofactors, functioning in cellular signaling, acting as phosphate group donors, and generating cellular energy. Maintenance of the proper balance of intracellular pools of these nucleotides is critical to normal function. This occurs through a combination of de novo biosynthesis and salvage pathways for pre-existing purine bases, nucleosides and nucleotides.  The de novo biosynthetic pathway for purine nucleotides is highly conserved among organisms, but its regulation and the organization of the genes encoding the enzymes vary. This fourteen step pathway contains ten steps that branch at IMP to form AMP and GMP, each in two steps. Regulation of the pathway has been well studied in microbes such as Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but little is known about its regulation in higher eukaryotes (metazoa, and plants).
