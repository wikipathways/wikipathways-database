    "description": "\"Targeting YAP for PDAC therapy. There are several strategies for targeting YAP in PDAC. Statin-mediated inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase in the mevalonate pathway reduces the geranylgeranylation and membrane localization of Rho GTPases, restricting YAP nuclear accumulation and thus its activity. Verteporfin and VGLL4-mimicking peptides disrupt the interaction between YAP and TEAD, inhibiting YAP-induced transcription. Metformin activates AMPK, which inhibits YAP both directly and by activating LATS kinases. BET inhibitors oppose the transcription of YAP-regulated genes. Neratinib increases the phosphorylation of LATS1 and YAP, causing YAP cytosolic accumulation and degradation.\" Based on Figure F5 in https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33408779/.
