    "description": "Triacylglycerol (TAG) is the major lipid reserve in plants and animals. The assembly of TAG occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Four consecutive reactions are catalyzed by ER membrane bound enzymes. The two intermediates, phosphatidate and 1,2-diacylglycerol, are also substrates for the synthesis of membrane lipids glycosylglycerides and phosphoglycerides. Thus, the last step in the pathway, catalyzed by diacylglycerol acyltransferase, is the only dedicated step in triacylglycerol synthesis.
