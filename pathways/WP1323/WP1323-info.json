    "description": "The androgen receptor is a member of the nuclear receptor family of ligand activated transcription factors. These receptors bind to steroid hormones, thyroid hormone, retinoids and vitamin D among others, dimerize and bind to DNA. Its ligands include testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone and androstenedione. Stimulation of the receptor activates the SMAD signaling module.
