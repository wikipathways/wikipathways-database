    "description": "Pyrimidine metabolism disorders are caused by enzyme defects in the metabolism of pyrimidine (WP4225). The clinical presentation of pyrimidine disorders is very diverse, because of the diversity in biological function. The severity of the disorder is determined by the severity of the defect and the function of the normal enzyme. The diagnosis of Pyrimidine metabolism disorders is based on altered concentrations of different metabolic biochemical markers. Some of these markers are metabolites in the pyrimidine metabolism, but there are also several other markers, that are either indirectly or not related to pyrimidine metabolism. All metabolic markers used for the diagnosis of at least one Pyrimidine metabolism disorder and their relations are visualized in this pathway.  Biochemical markers derived from [IEMbase](http://www.iembase.org/), for all diseases pictured in WP4225. ",
