    "description": "This pathway shows disorders related to the accumulation of organic acids in body fluids, resulting in cerebral organic acidurias. Symptoms often include mental or motor retardation, difficulties while moving and epilepsy. For all but one disorder, current treatment options have been proven ineffective. Disorders resulting from an enzyme defect are highlighted in pink. This pathway was inspired by Chapter 8 of the book of Blau (ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361)).",
