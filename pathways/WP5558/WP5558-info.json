    "description": "Suzetrigine (trade name Journavx) is an oral medication used to manage moderate to severe acute pain. It is a non-opioid, small-molecule analgesic that functions by selectively inhibiting Nav1.8-dependent pain signaling pathways in the peripheral nervous system. Unlike opioids, suzetrigine is non-addictive.  Inspired by Figure 2 in [Cho et al. (2025)](https://www.cell.com/trends/pharmacological-sciences/abstract/S0165-6147(25)00028-8).",
