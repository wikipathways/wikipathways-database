    "description": "This Arabidopsis seed development pathway network in GPML format was projected using the reference rice seed development network [[Pathway:WP2199]] and the Arabidopsis to rice gene homology data sets. The green colored nodes (genes) represent where the Inparanoid-based gene homology was positively predicted based on the cutoffs used. The tool used for making the projection was [http://jaiswallab.cgrb.oregonstate.edu/software/PGS Pathway GeneSWAPPER]. Method is described in the publication [http://www.thericejournal.com/content/6/1/14/ Hanumappa et al. (2013)]. This method creates a new projection, but preserves the interactions between nodes.",
