    "description": "This Arabidopsis seed development pathway network in GPML format was projected using the reference rice seed development network [WP2199](https://www.wikipathways.org/pathways/WP2199.html) and the Arabidopsis to rice gene homology data sets. The green colored nodes (genes) represent where the Inparanoid-based gene homology was positively predicted based on the cutoffs used. The tool used for making the projection was [Pathway GeneSWAPPER](http://jaiswallab.cgrb.oregonstate.edu/software/PGS). Method is described in the publication [Hanumappa et al. (2013)](http://www.thericejournal.com/content/6/1/14/). This method creates a new projection, but preserves the interactions between nodes.",
