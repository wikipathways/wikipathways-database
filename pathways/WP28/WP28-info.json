    "description": "Organic and inorganic sources of selenium from diet are metabolised by a series of reactions, leading to SeC biosynthesis and transcriptional regulation of a set of selenoproteins. Also refer to the selenoprotein database at [www.selenodb.org](http://www.selenodb.org).  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP28).",
