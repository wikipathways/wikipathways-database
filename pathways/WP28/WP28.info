description: * Comments belonging to specific genes on the Selenoprotein pathway ** TRXND3 gene: Although the geneID is correct, the sequence of this gene was guessed by analogy. ** Cystathionine gamma-lyase is the mammalian form of bacterial methionine gamma-lyase ** A selenoprotein database exists at: http://www.selenodb.org.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP28 CPTAC Assay Portal]
