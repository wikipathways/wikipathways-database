    "description": "NMRK2 mRNA acts as a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and enhancing mitochondrial respiration in NONO-TFE3 translocation renal cell carcinoma (tRCC).  NMRK2 functions as a molecular scaffold to promote mitochondrial function in these cancer cells, independent of NAD+ kinase activity.  NMRK2 upregulation contributes to tumor progression by improving cellular energy production through enhanced mitochondrial respiration. Targeting NMRK2 might help treat this aggressive RCC subtype.",
