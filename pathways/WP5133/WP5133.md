description: Vitamin D is known for its participation in various skeletal and non-skeletal
  muscle homeostasis. In addition to Calcium (Ca²⁺) and phosphorous (P) absorption,
  its association with CVD, hypertention, cancer, obesity, diabetes and immune system
  has been reported. It actively participates in the regulation of cardiovascular
  system through Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone System (RAAS). Renin is secreted by
  the kidney and it activates the formation of angiotensin II that leads to the decreased
  production of nitric oxide (NO) and increased endothelial vascular dysfunction (Pérez-Hernández
  et al., 2016). Vitamin D causes the insulin release, facilitates muscle contraction
  and glucose uptake by enhancing the activity of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) channels
  in the cells (Berridge, 2017) and reduces the aldosterone . From last few years
  vitamin D has gained special attention as immunomodulatory agent. The immunologic
  cells such as B cells, T cells, and antigen presenting cells express vitamin D receptors
  on their cells as well as are capable of synthesizing vitamin D metabolites especially
  calcitriol. The beneficial effects of vitamin D are linked with both innate and
  adaptive immune systems. During vitamin D deficiency an unwanted production of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines cause atherosclerotic lesions and atherogenesis. These conditions lead
  to increased vasoconstriction and decreased vasodilation, endothelial dysfunction,
  and alleviated nitric oxide formation. Furthermore, the expression of angiotensin-converting
  enzyme 2 (ACE2; responsible for the retrospective production of Ang1-7 form Ang
  II) is also reduced in vitamin D deficient subjects. Such individuals are more vulnerable
  to infectious diseases, especially, recent pandemic of COVID-19 (Malek Mahdavi,
  2020).
