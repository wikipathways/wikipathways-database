    "description": "A recent study by the Dutch RIVM found that across The Netherlands seven PFAS are found in every tested human, with an additional nine found in at least 10% of the population. Three of these PFAS were found to be associated to cancer.  <p>PFOS, PFHxS, and PFOA were found to be significantly positively associated with testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT) among U.S. Air Force servicemen [PMID:37458713 ]. Data from a 2-year bioassay study on rats did not support a PFOS-related effect on testicular tumors, while serum PFOS concentrations were much higher in magnitude compared to levels reported in the former study [PMID:37751326]. This last study focussed on Leydig cell tumors (LCTs), which were described to not be comparable to TGCT [PMID:38099920]. Furthermore, the animal model used in that study (Sprague-Dawley rats) for assessing environmental risk factors of human LCTs is questionable due to mechanistic differences in carcinogenesis as well as  incidence rate of spontaneous LCTs [PMID:38099920]. This literary discussion concluded with another article, suggesting that the data collected on rats was not directly translational to humans, but should be included to obtain a full view of the potential effects of PFAS compounds [PMID:38099921].",
