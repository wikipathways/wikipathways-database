    "description": "The PI3K-Akt signaling pathway can be activated by many types of cellular stimuli or toxic insults and regulates many fundamental cellular functions. Activated PI3K  phosphorylates AKT, thereby activating it. Once active, Akt controls a number of downstream cellular processes, including apoptosis, protein synthesis, metabolism, and cell cycle, by phosphorylating a range of substrates. Phosphorylation sites were added based on information from PhosphoSitePlus (R), www.phosphosite.org.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP4172)",
