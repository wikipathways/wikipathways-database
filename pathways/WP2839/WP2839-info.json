    "description": "The hair follicle (HF) is the biological unit responsible for producing a single hair shaft. The follicles are arranged with concentric epithelial progenitor layers surrounding the dermal core, which is the dermal papilla (DP). Classically, the development of the follicle itself can be divided into three stages: [Induction](https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP2804), Organogenesis and [Cytodifferentiation](https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP2840).  Hair follicle development is a process dependent on epithelial-mesenchymal transitions orchestrated by many signaling pathways. Here we find one of three complex regulatory pathways assembled from a text mining approach portraying the development of this key mammal-specific structure.",
