    "description": "In biochemistry, eicosanoids are signaling molecules made by oxidation of twenty-carbon essential fatty acids, (EFAs). They exert complex control over many bodily systems, mainly in inflammation or immunity, and as messengers in the central nervous system. Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eicosanoid).  This pathway has been updated with information from [LIPID MAPS>Eicosanoids](https://lipidmaps.org/resources/pathways/vanted.php). Metabolites and proteins from this pathway are orange coloured and have an rounded rectangle shape (where an rectangle shape indicates that the node only occures in the LIPID MAPS pathway).  Reactions occurring in the LIPID MAPS pathways are coloured orange (where a dashed line indicates that the reaction only occures in the LIPID MAPS pathway).  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP167)",
