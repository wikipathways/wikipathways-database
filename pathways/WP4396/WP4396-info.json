    "description": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a condition in which too much fat is stored in the liver. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH; also known as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis / MASH) is a type of NAFLD marked by liver inflammation, which may progress to scarring and irreversible damage similar to that caused by heavy alcohol use. Components of glucose metabolism, insulin signaling, inflammation, oxidative stress, ER stress, and apoptosis are all involved and interconnected in the progression of this disease.",
