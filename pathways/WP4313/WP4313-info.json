    "description": "Ferroptosis is a type of programmed cell death which is distinct from apoptosis and necrosis, since cell death occurs due to failure of the glutathione-dependent antioxidant defenses in regulating iron. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced from accumulated iron and lipid peroxidation (regulated by GrX4 and 15-LO).  Ferroptosis is important in several physiological and pathological processes, including cancer cell death, mitochondrial dysfunction induced epilepsy and neurodegenerative disease. Ferroptosis can be induced to treat multiple forms of cancer by inhibiting tumor growth, although the exact mechanism is unknown. Ferroptosis has also been linked to neurodegenerative disease, possibly through increased inflammation caused by release of lipid metabolites.
