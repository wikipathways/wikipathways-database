    "description": "Effect of dasatinib on the BCR-ABL signaling pathway, showing phosphorylation sites that were found to be suppressed by Dasatinib are shown (Pan et al). Key signaling events in the three major MAPK cascades were suppressed, including the activation loop phosphorylation sites of p38α/β (MAPK11) and ERK1/2 (MAPK1/MAPK3).  Based on fig 6 from https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2816010/Phosphorylation site information is based on the left-side panel in the figure; not all sites could be verified in independent sources (e.g. PhosphositePlus).
