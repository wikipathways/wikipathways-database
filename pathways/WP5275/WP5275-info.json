    "description": "Ether lipid biosynthesis in humans.  Ether lipids (e.g. plasmalogens), are peroxisome-derived glycerophospholipids where the hydrocarbon chain at the sn-1 position of the glycerol backbone is attached by an ether bond (single bond between carbon and oxygen atom). Ether lipids are used to form non-lamellar inverted hexagonal structures in model membranes (indicating they could facilitate membrane fusion processes). Lipid raft microdomains (cholesterol-rich membrane regions involved in cellular signaling) rely on ether lipids for their organization and stability. [PMID:28523433].  The pathway knowledge depicted in this model stems from Robert C. Murphy, who endorsed version r123734.  Metabolic conversion missing an identifier from Rhea have been visualized with double line thickness.",
