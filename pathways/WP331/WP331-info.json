    "description": "Threonine biosynthesis as shown here covers the process of converting L-Aspartate into threonine. This pathway is regulated at multiple points by its end product, both via enzyme inhibition and attenuation. There is a three-step pathway that converts L-aspartate into homoserine. Two of the three enzymes that catalyze the first step in this pathway are bifunctional, also serving to catalyze the later step in the pathway. Homoserine feeds into biosynthetic pathways for both threonine and methionine. Fittingly, this pathway is regulated by the outputs of both of those pathways.
