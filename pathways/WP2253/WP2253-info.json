    "description": "This pathway shows the relationship between BRAF signaling and the development and behavior of pilocytic astrocytoma (PA), normally induced by MAPK pathway activation.   BRAF is related in two alternative mechanisms in MAPK activation. The first is oncogenic fusion between SRGAP3 and RAF1, highlighted in yellow.  The second is a 3 basepair insertion in BRAF (KIAA1549), also highlighted in yellow.   This pathway is based on Figure 3 \"An overview of MAPK pathway alterations in PAs\" from [Jones et al](https://doi.org/10.1038/onc.2009.73).",
