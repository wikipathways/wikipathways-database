    "description": "In biochemistry, eicosanoids are signaling molecules made by oxidation of twenty-carbon essential fatty acids, (EFAs). They exert complex control over many bodily systems, mainly in inflammation or immunity, and as messengers in the central nervous system. Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eicosanoid).  This pathway is inspired by the [Lipidmaps>Eicosanoids pathway](https://lipidmaps.org/resources/pathways/vanted.php). For Homo sapiens, the information from this pathway has been integrated with the pre-existing pathway at [WikiPathways](https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP167).",
