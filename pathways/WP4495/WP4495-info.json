    "description": "IL-10 binds to its respective IL-10 receptor which activates the JAK/STAT pathway and MAPK pathway involving the p38 kinases. This leads to the induction of the enzyme heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1) which is involved in the biosynthesis of heme, and catalyzes the reaction producing the heme precursor biliverdin. The ani-inflammatory actions of HMOX appear to be the result of signaling by carbon monoxide which inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokine production. ",
