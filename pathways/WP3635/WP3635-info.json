    "description": "The paper describes insulin signaling in human adipocytes under normal and diabetic states using mathematical models based on experimental data. This model corresponds to insulin signaling under diabetic condition. Insulin signaling under normal condition is represented in WP3634. The model has been converted to GPML using the PathSBML plugin from PathVisio, importing the model BIOMD0000000449 from the BioModels Database directly. The layout has been improved manually.",
