    "description": "This pathway is inspired by the LipidMaps, Sterol lipids expended pathway display (https://lipidmaps.org/pathway/pathways_maps) and extended with Scheme 1 from Acimovic et al 2013. Literature suggests that cholesterol synthesis preferentially starts with the Bloch pathway, however there is a shift to the Kandutsch-Russell part via lathosterol from Bae et al, 1997. Dashed lines indicate that multiple steps are involved to create the final product. ",
