    "description": "\"The localization, as well as some interaction and modification of the principal proteins involved in the two processes are shown. Once dephosphorylated, DRP1 is recruited to the outer membrane by FIS1 or by another, unknown, component. The oligomerization of DRP1 is followed by constriction of the membrane and mitochondrial fission. The pro-fusion proteins (MFNs on the outer membrane and OPA1 on the inner membrane) oligomerize to induce fusion of the membranes. Other additional components of the machinery are shown.\" [Silvia Campello and Luca Scorrano 2010](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2933866/); diagram derived from Figure 1.",
