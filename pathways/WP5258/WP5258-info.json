    "description": "Proposed mechanism for COVID-19 induced endothelial dysfunction via ROS, as described by Ma et Al. (2022). TNF-α stimulation of NADPH oxidase leads to accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Increased levels of IFN reduces the expression of functional ACE2, which leads to increased ROS via imbalanced RAS signaling. Excessive ROS disturbs vascular tone and increases endothelial permeability.  Description modified from [https://europepmc.org/article/MED/34838588 Ma et. al.].",
