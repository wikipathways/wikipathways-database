    "description": "Glycolysis is the metabolic pathway that converts glucose C6H12O6, into pyruvate, CH3COCOO- and H+. The free energy released in this process is used to form the ATP and NADH. Gluconeogenesis is a metabolic pathway that results in the generation of glucose from non-carbohydrate carbon substrates such as pyruvate, lactate, glycerol, glucogenic amino acids, and fatty acids. Description adapted from [Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org).  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP534).",
