    "description": "Lacto series glycosphingolipid biosynthesis. Lactosylceramides (abbreviated as LacCer) are a class of glycosphingolipids connecting a ceramide lipid to a sugar group. The exact chemical formula and molecular weight in this class of lipids varies depending on the connected fatty-acid.  Many of these structures are related to cancer development or antigens.
