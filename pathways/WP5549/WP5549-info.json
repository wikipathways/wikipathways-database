    "description": "Following the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, increasing evidence suggests that the overactivation of the tryptophan-kynurenine pathway (TKP) plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of post-COVID syndrome (PCS). This dysregulation is marked by reduced tryptophan (TRP) levels and elevated concentrations of specific tryptophan catabolites (TRYCATs). Notably, heightened TKP activity has been observed in patients exhibiting symptoms of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). In fact, elevated levels of TKP metabolites such as quinolinic acid, 3- hydroxy anthranilic acid and kynurenine, have been associated with cognitive impairments. Persistent inflammatory conditions observed in Post-Covid patients potentially upregulate the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) enzymes, specifically IDO 1, as well as KMO, which catalyses the conversion from Kynurenine to 3-Hydroxykynurenine. Thus, the kynurenine pathway relates to PACS and potentially enables future biomarker and therapeutic possibilities. ",
