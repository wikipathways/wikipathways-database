description: This pathway is based on figure 6 from Li et al. BMP2 is activated by cAMP which promotes WNT4 expression in Human Primary Endometrial Stromal Cells (HPESCs) through SMAD1/5/8. WNT4 then induces FOXO1 function through B-Catenin which indirectly stimulates HPESC differentiation. DKKs and SFRPs are activated by BMP2 inhibit WNT4 and stop downstream signaling.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3876 CPTAC Assay Portal]
