    "description": "This pathway is based on the figure 24.1 of \"In Vitro Signaling by MAPK and NFÎºB Pathways Inhibited by Yersinia YopJ\" (see bibliography). In the MAPK and NFkB pathways, YopJ is the main inhibitor of Raf and TRAF6, NIK, or MEKK1. YopJ, in the NFkB pathway, may inhibit TRAF6, NIK, or MEKK.  The pathway is activated by the stimulus of the  genes TRAF6, NIK, or MEKK1, or the stimulus on the interactions between Ras to Raf. In the NFkB pathway along with the MAPK pathway, with the use of activators such as kinases, G-proteins, and E3 ligases, are catalysts to initiate of signaling cascades with a concentrated lysate.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3849)",
