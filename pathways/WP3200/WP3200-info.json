    "description": "PDGF belongs to the PDGF/VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) family, which is characterized by eight strictly conserved cysteine residues with similar spacing in between (Joukov et al., 1997; Heldin and Westermark, 1999). The A-, B-, C-, and D-chain genes of PDGF are localized to the chromosomes 7p22, 22q13, 4q31, and 11q22, respectively, and their expression is independently regulated. Two forms of the PDGF A-chain, containing 196 and 211 amino acid residues resulting from differential splicing of the transcript, are synthesized, dimerized, proteolytically processed in the Nterminus, and secreted from the cell as a ~30 kDa dimer. The PDGF B chain encoding 241 amino acid residues is dimerized, processed by additional proteolysis, and secreted as a 24 kDa dimer. The homodimers PDGF AA, BB, and the heterodimer AB contain three intrachain disulfide bonds.",
