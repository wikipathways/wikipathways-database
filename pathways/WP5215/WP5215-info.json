    "description": "Schematic of the most relevant molecular pathways and targeted agents in tripe negative breast cancer (TNBC). Tyrosine kinase receptor is activated upon binding of growth factors leading to activation of signaling pathways. PI3K/AKT pathway and inhibitor drugs: Phosphorylated PI3K activate AKT. The activation of AKT triggers downstream protein complexes mTORC activation that initiate gene transcription and promote cell growth. AR pathway is activated in LAR subtype tumors. Platinum drugs act through DNA damaging mechanism. PARP inhibitors induce \u201csynthetic lethality\u201d in BRCA deficient tumors. Pathway is based on figure figure in [Vagia et al](https://europepmc.org/article/MED/32276534).",
