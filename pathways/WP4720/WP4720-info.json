    "description": "This pathway is inspired by the [LIPID MAPS>Eicosanoids Pathway expended pathway display](https://lipidmaps.org/pathway/pathways_maps) and extended with the bottom left side of Figure 1 from ([Dennis and Norris (2015)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26139350)). Eicosanoids are a large group of compounds metabolised from arachidonic acid (AA), either via cyclooxygenases (COX) [WP4347](https://www.wikipathways.org/pathways/WP4347.html), lipooxygenases(LOX) [WP4348](https://www.wikipathways.org/pathways/WP4348.html), or cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYP) [WP4349](https://www.wikipathways.org/pathways/WP4349.html). This pathway visualizes the third route, via CYP.  Orange boxes represent peroxisome-proliferator activating receptors (PPARs) potentially activated by the eicosanoids.",
