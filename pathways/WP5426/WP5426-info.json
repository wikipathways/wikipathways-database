    "description": "HDAC6 stands out as a distinctive member within the histone deacetylase family due to its predominant presence in the cytosol, facilitating its interaction with a wide array of non-histone proteins. Its dysregulation has been linked to various outcomes, encompassing diverse cancer types, immune-related disorders, and neurological conditions, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, ALS, Huntington's, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, and Rett syndrome. The current network represents the known HDAC6 interactions in the central nervous system (CNS).",
