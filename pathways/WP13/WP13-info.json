    "description": "DNA replication, the basis for biological inheritance, is a fundamental process occurring in all living organisms to copy their DNA. This process is \"replication\" in that each strand of the original double-stranded DNA molecule serves as template for the reproduction of the complementary strand. Hence, following DNA replication, two identical DNA molecules have been produced from a single double-stranded DNA molecule. Cellular proofreading and error-checking mechanisms ensure near perfect fidelity for DNA replication.  Source: [wikipedia:DNA_replication|Wikipedia]  Based on www.genomeknowledge.org",
