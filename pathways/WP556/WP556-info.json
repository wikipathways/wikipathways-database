    "description": "In S. cerevisiae, the main pathway for glutamate degradation is catalyzed by the glutamate dehydrogenase encoded by GDH2 ([WP503](https://www.wikipathways.org/pathways/WP503.html)). However, glutamate can also by degraded into gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA) by the glutamate decarboxylase Gad1p and then converted into succinate by the enzymes encoded by UGA1 and UGA2.  Based on [Yeast Pathways](https://pathway.yeastgenome.org/).",
