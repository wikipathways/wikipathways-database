    "description": "FBXL10, a member of Polycomb repressive complexes, is overexpressed in human diffuse large B-cell lymphoma tissues and cell lines. FBXL10 silences the expression of DUSP6 through recruitment of polycomb repressuive complexes, which leads to the deposition of repressive histone modifications in the DUPS6 promoter. DUSP6 is a ERK1/2 (MAPK1/MAPK3) phosphatase and with lower levels of DUSP6, ERK1/2 remain phosphorylated and thus activates downstream ERK/MAPK signaling and ultimately cell proliferation. Based on figure 7 in [Zhao et al](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5833345/). ",
