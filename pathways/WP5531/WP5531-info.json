    "description": "There are only a few conflicting findings regarding the regulation of ARTD family members by AKT signaling. In one type of astrocyte, seizure induction increased both PARP1 levels and enzymatic activity, whereas in another type, seizures resulted in a decrease in PARP1 and its activity. In both scenarios, inhibiting AKT signaling reduced PARP1 protein levels and activity. This suggests that AKT may play a role in promoting PARP1 expression and signaling.  Inspired by figure 5 in [Boehi et al. (2021)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8560908/#Sec22).",
