    "description": "Teichoic acids serve several roles in the cell. They serve as reservoirs of phosphates that can be mobilized when phosphate becomes limiting. Being anionic, they are scavengers of cations (in particular Mg2+), and may create a pH gradient across the wall by sequestering the protons expelled through the cytoplasmic membrane. In addition, lipoteichoic acids are the main source of the hydrophobicity of the cell envelope, and may contribute to its adhesiveness. Teichoic acids are also immunogenic, and can be considered the Gram-positive equivalent of the Gram-negative lipopolysaccharides.",
