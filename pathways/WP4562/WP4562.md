description: The canonical NF-KB pathway is induced by the ligand-dependent activation
  of a variety of receptors. Stimulus-dependent activation of the IKK complex results
  in the phosphorylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation of IκBα and IκBε (NFKBIA
  and NFKBIE). This allows the nuclear translocation of transcriptionally active RelA/p50
  (RELA, NFKB1) or c-Rel/p50 heterodimers (REL, NFKB1).
