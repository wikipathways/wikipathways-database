    "description": "The genes hypoxia-inducible factor 1A and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma play a role in regulating glycolysis, triacylglyceride synthesis, and ultimately hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  This diagram is derived from Figure 6D in [PMID:19490906](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19490906/):  \"Schematic representation of the coregulation of glycolysis and glycerolipid synthesis by HIF1A. Hypertrophy-induced HIF1A accumulation is predicted to simultaneously promote the transcriptional upregulation of glycolytic enzymes and the direct transcriptional activation of the PPARG promoter. PPARG activity would lead to the upregulation of its target genes, GPD1 and GPAT, leading to promotion of glycerolipid biosynthesis, culminating in TAG accumulation. A secondary level of coordination is predicted to occur via the shuttling of NADH and NAD+ between GAPDH and GPD1. Thus, coordinated regulation of both these components by HIF1A is hypothesized to favor cardiomyocyte lipid accumulation in hypertrophy.\"  This pathway is part the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2456).",
