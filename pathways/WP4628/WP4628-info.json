    "description": "Glycolysis converts glucose, C6H12O6, into pyruvate, CH3COCOO- and H+. The free energy released in this process is used to form the ATP and NADH. This pathway shows changed glycolytic fluxes during the Warburg effect. It is an extended version of the glycolysis pathway ([WP534](https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP534)), and describes content in the computer model of the corresponding supplement, and the article of [Shestov et al., 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25009227). Passive transport of oxygen and lactic acid into the cell is depicted using dashed arrows, which may differ from the original computer model.   Referred article: [Shestov et al., 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25009227)",
