description: 'Even in the presence of oxygen, cancer cells convert glucose to lactate
  as their main source for energy production, instead of using the citric acid cycle
  and oxidative phosphorylation. This process is called the Warburg effect. This pathway
  shows the effects deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) and their substrates have. DUBs
  free proteins of their ubiquitin chain, so that the proteins can resume their function
  in the cells rather than be degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS).  The
  deubiquitination of VHL via OTUD6B (part of a DUB subfamily) represses HIF-1α, whereas
  the direct deubiquitination of HIF-1a via DUBs leads to the increased expression
  of GLUT1 and VEGF. The transcription factor c-Myc helps regulate gene expression
  involved in the glucose metabolism (e.g., GLUT1, HK2, LDHA) and is stabilised by
  ubiquitin-specific proteases.  The PI3K/Akt pathway is also upregulated by deubiquitination
  of VEGF and Akt. This entails cell growth and apoptosis regulation, as well as promoted
  glucose transport to cancer cells and activating mTor, which improves glycolysis.
  It is shown in this pathway, how deubiquitinating enzymes play an important role
  in stabilizing different proteins, acting as oncoproteins and tumor suppressors
  equally. This pathway is based on figure 3 featured in “Regulation of Cancer Metabolism
  by Deubiquitinating Enzymes: The Warburg Effect” by So-Hee Kim and Kwang-Hyun Baek.'
