description: Dyslipidemia is a change (either increase or decrease) of adipose levels within the blood. When there is a significant increase of this, the term hyperlipidemia is used. With a significant decrease, we talk about hypolipoproteinemia. Both hyperlipidemia and hypolipoproteinemia can be classified as either acquired or familial.  Familial hyperlipidemia can be classified in five types according to the Fredrickson classification.For this classification see Quispe et al. 2019 http://dx.doi.org/10.5114/aoms.2019.87207.  Lipodystrophy is a change (either increase or decrease) of adipose levels within the lipid tissue deposits. Lipodystrophy is classified based on wether the disease is acquired or congenital, but also wether it is geralized (through the entire body) or partial (in specific parts of the body). This classification was based on the following information by Akinci et al. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK513130/]
