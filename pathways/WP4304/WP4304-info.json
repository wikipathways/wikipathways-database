    "description": "Overview of synthesis of components for myelin sheath of the CNS in oligodendrocytes. \"Multi-potent neural stem cells are specified into oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. OPCs can differentiate into multiple cell types including astrocytes, neurons, and Schwann cells. Differentiation along the oligodendroglial lineage to pre-oligodendrocytes/immature oligodendrocytes is potentiated by the growth factor IGF-1, the cytokine CNTF, and the thyroid hormone T3, and requires several transcription factors. BMPs can inhibit this step, as well as the previous one. Differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes is associated with acquisition of myelin-related proteins.\" Rephrased from [Miron et al, 2011, Figure 1C+D]. ",
