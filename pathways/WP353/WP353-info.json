    "description": "G protein\u2013coupled receptors (GPCRs) which are also known as seven-(pass)-transmembrane domain receptors, 7TM receptors, heptahelical receptors, serpentine receptor, and G protein\u2013linked receptors (GPLR), constitute a large protein family of receptors that detect molecules outside the cell and activate internal signal transduction pathways and, ultimately, cellular responses. Coupling with G proteins, they are called seven-transmembrane receptors because they pass through the cell membrane seven times. Source: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_protein\u2013coupled_receptor Wikipedia]  These small ligand receptors are part of the Rhodopsin-like family of GPCRs.
