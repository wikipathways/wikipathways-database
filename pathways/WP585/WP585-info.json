    "description": "The type I IFNs (IFNα family, IFNβ, IFNω, IFNε and IFNκ) all bind to and signal via the type I IFN receptor complex. The type I receptor consists of two main IFNAR1, IFNAR2c receptor chains and other accessory proteins. The pathway above  (WP585) describes the Type I Interferon signaling pathways and shows both classical IFN signaling via the JAK-STAT pathway (dark lines) and other non-canonical IFN signaling pathways.   Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP585 CPTAC Assay Portal]",
