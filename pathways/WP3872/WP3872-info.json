    "description": "This pathway is based on Figure 8 of \"Parathyroid hormone-related protein regulates cell survival pathways via integrin alpha6beta4-mediated activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling.\"(See Bibliography). Intracrine PTHrP inhibits apoptosis by activating the PI3-K/Akt pathway by increasing levels of integrin A6B4, which signals in harmony with growth factor receptors. The activation of Akt increases the ratio of anti-apoptosis members to pro-apoptosis members in the Bcl-2 family. The activation of Akt deactivates GSK-3 which leads to higher levels of c-myc, therefore leading to lower levels of apoptosis. Overall, intracrine PTHrP has the effect of increased cell survival on C4-2 cells.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3872)",
