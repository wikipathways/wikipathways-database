  <Comment Source="WikiPathways-description">This event has been computationally inferred from an event that has been demonstrated in another species.&lt;p&gt;The inference is based on Ensembl Compara orthology projection. Briefly, reactions for which all involved PhysicalEntities (in input, output and catalyst) have a mapped ortholog or paralog are inferred to the other species. High-level events are also inferred for these events to allow for easier navigation.&lt;p&gt;Details of projection methods and parameters may be found &lt;a href="/projection.html"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;
