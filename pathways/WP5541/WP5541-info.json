    "description": "Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a neurotrophin essential for neuron growth, differentiation, plasticity, and survival. BDNF binds tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) with low affinity. Binding to TrkB activates the receptor through dimerization and autophosphorylation, which leads to phosphobinding sites for adaptor proteins FRS2, SCH1, and SH2B2. These adaptor proteins activate CREB1 through the RAS/ERK pathway. IRS1/2 activates the PI3K/AKT pathway, resulting in the activation of beta-catenin. TrkB can form a complex with p75NTR, resulting in the activation of kiddins220, activating the RAS/ERK pathway from a different route. Binding of pto-BNDF to the P75NTR Sortilin dimer resulted in the recruitment of adaptor proteins such as RAC1/CDC42, TRADD/FAD, activating MAPK8 and caspase 8, respectively. Additionally, pro-BDNF binding induces the synthesis of ceramides, resulting in the inhibition of RAS. ",
