    "description": "Metabolic pathway of N-glycan biosynthesis in Ovis aries (sheep). N-linked glycosylation is the process where an oligosaccharide is transferred from a lipid carrier to an asparagine residue of a polypeptide. The first steps of N-linked glycosylation take place on the surface of the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER), while further remodeling is performed in the Golgi apparatus. The modification in the Golgi apparatus is species-, cell-type-, and protein-specific which provides a very broad structural diversity in N-glycans.  Broadly speaking, the role of protein-linked glycans is to function as specific binding determinants or modulators of the proteins that they are attached to.
