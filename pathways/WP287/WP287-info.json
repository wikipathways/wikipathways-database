    "description": "The main ubiquinone in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and other Saccharomycetes species is ubiquinone-6. Biosynthesis of 4-hydroxybenzoate, one of the precursors, can occur in yeast by two different paths - it may be produced directly from chorismate by the chorismate pyruvate-lyase reaction (similar to the common pathway in prokaryotes), or it can be synthesized from L-tyrosine, similar to higher eukaryotes (see 4-hydroxybenzoate biosynthesis I (eukaryotes)). At least 10 genes (COQ1-COQ10) have been shown to be required for synthesis of ubiquinone in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  At least six of these proteins (COQ3, COQ4, COQ5, COQ6, COQ7 and COQ9) were shown to form a complex, which may be attached to the mitochindria inner membrane by the product of COQ2, an integral membrane protein.
