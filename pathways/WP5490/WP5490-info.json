    "description": "This pathway describes parallel and converging signaling pathways driven by GNAQ (GÎ±q) in uveal melanoma, and the inhibitory effects of darovasertib and FAKi (FAK inhibitor). Key points from [Arang et al](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10694608/): Darovasertib is a dual inhibitor of PKC and PRK/PKN; downstream of mutant GNAQ darovasertib blocks ERK and diminishes FAK activity; Darovasertib and FAKi act synergistically in preclinical uveal melanoma models.  This pathway model was developed based on Figure 7 in [Arang et al](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10694608/).",
