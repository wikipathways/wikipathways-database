    "description": "Platelets generate TXA2, which binds to its receptor (TP) on T cells, initiating the activation of ARHGEF1, a guanine exchange factor that promotes the conversion of RhoA from its inactive GDP-bound state to its active GTP-bound form. This RhoA activation inhibits TCR-induced kinase pathways, T cell proliferation, and effector functions, ultimately suppressing anti-metastatic immunity. TXA2 production by platelets is COX1-dependent and can be blocked by aspirin or COX-1 selective inhibitors, which relieve T cells from TXA2-mediated suppression.  Inspired by figure 14 in in [Yang et al. (2025)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08626-7)..",
