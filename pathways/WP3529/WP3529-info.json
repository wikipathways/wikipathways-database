    "description": "Zinc is a transition metal and catalytic cofactor involved in many biological processes such as proliferation, development and differentiation, regulation of DNA synthesis, genomic stability, cell activation, RNA transcription, immune function. Zinc homeostasis in cells is ensured by various protein families including zinc transporters, zinc-binding proteins (Metallothioneins, MTs), transcription factors (MTF1-2). ZnT (1-10) transporters are responsible of zinc efflux and are assigned to the SLC30A family while ZIP (1-14) transporters are responsible for the influx of zinc into the cytoplasm and are assigned to the SLC39A family. Zn2+ enters into the cell by the ZIP transporters, and once inside the cell is available to bind metalloproteins (MT) which deliver to ZnT, or the zinc can bind to directly ZnTs and then deliver in the organelles / vesicles or lead outside the cell. Elevated zinc levels have been reported in different tumour tissue, such as breast and lung cancer",
