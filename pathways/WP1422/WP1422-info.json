    "description": "The sphingolipid metabolites and genes (with the gene abbreviations shown in boxes, or enzyme names where gene names are ambiguous) are given for the condensation of serine and palmitoyl-CoA to form 3-ketosphinganine (3-ketoSa) by serine palmitoyltransferase, which is reduced to sphinganine (Sa), acylated to dihydroceramides, DHCer, by (DH)Cer synthases, and incorporated into more complex DH-sphingolipids (the 1-phosphate, DHCerP, sphingomyelins, DHSM, glucosylceramides, DHGlcCer, galactosylceramides, DHGalCer, lactosylceramides, DHLacCer, and sulfatides, or desaturated to Cer followed by headgroup addition. Also included are a number of the catabolic genes, e.g., sphingomyelinases, SMases, ceramidases, ASAH, sphingosine kinases, for the formation of sphinganine 1-phosphate (Sa1P) and sphingosine 1-phosphate (So1P), and phosphatases for the reverse reaction and the lyase that cleaves sphingoid base 1-phosphates to ethanolamine phosphate (EP), hexadecanal (C16:0al) and hexadecenal (C16:1al).  This pathway has been updated with information from [Lipidmaps>Sphingolipids(https://lipidmaps.org/resources/pathways/vanted.php). Metabolites and proteins from this pathway are coloured orange and have a rounded rectangle shape (where an oval shape indicates that the node only occurs in the LipidMaps pathway). Reactions occurring in the lipidmaps pathways are coloured orange (where a dashed line indicates that the reaction only occurs in the LipidMaps pathway).",
