    "description": "This pathway shows the (one) carbon metabolism over grey and related pathways around it.  The one carbon donor pathway (WP2190) has been added to this one (additional conversions are coloured green for clarity of the origin); as well as WP3940 (overlapping content in bold), which was based on [https://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?pathway+mmu00270 KEGG] and inferred from Mus musculus pathway [http://wikipathways.org/instance/WP1770_r96326 WP1770_96326] with a 100.0% conversion rate.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2525 CPTAC Assay Portal].",
