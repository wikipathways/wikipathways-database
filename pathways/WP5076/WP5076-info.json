    "description": "ACE2 is a regulator of the renin-angiotensin system. To perform this function, ACE2 is transported to the cell surface, where it is cleaved by disintegrin and ADAM17 to produce an enzymatically active soluble form of ACE2. This soluble form retains the SARS-CoV-2 binding site. SARS-CoV-2 bound to either soluble ACE2 or soluble ACE2 and vasopressin then uses receptor-mediated endocytosis by through either AT1 or AVPR1B, respectively.   This figure is based on the graphical abstract from [Yeung et al.](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(21)00283-X).",
