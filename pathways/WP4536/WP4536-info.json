    "description": "The primary cilium is related Hedgehog signaling, embryonic and [brain development](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29030052). When it is dysregulated, it leads to [ciliopathies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21210154).  The genes in this pathway are related to several ciliary structures, which have been discovered with genome-wide CRISPR-mediated gene disruption.",
