    "description": "Interplay of RAC1, p38 MAPK, PAK1 and MMP2 in cell signaling pathways downstream of TEK receptor activity related to tumor growth, angiogenesis, and cell proliferation. These processes are reduced in RAC1 inactivated models of ovarian cancer. Gonzalez-Villasana, et al. Clin Cancer Res, 2015.   Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3303 ).",
