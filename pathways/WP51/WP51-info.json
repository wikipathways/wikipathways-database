    "description": "A cytoskeleton is a complex, dynamic network of interlinking protein filaments that extends from the cell nucleus to the cell membrane. Actin filaments, composed of the abundant actin protein, are a main component of the cytoskeleton, playing a key role muscle contraction.  With input from [KEGG](http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway/hsa/hsa04810.html).  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP51)",
