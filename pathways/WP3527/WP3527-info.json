    "description": "The source of this pathway is RNA-Seq data from single-cell pre-implantation embryos, Supplemental Table 1 from [Yan et al.](http://www.nature.com/nsmb/journal/v20/n9/full/nsmb.2660.html).  Analysis options for running the single-cell analysis workflow in AltAnalyze (ICGS): * For optimal filtering (not too restrictive), change the Fold change filter cutoff from 10 to 100 and the Minimum number of samples differing from 3 to 2. * Change the Select the column clustering method to hopach. * The final ICGS cell cluster groups (hopach) were further analyzed to identify genes with restricted expression in one of the identified sub-populations using the MarkerFinder algorithm in AltAnalyze (RPKM>1).  * MarkerFinder identified genes for each sub-population (e.g., 8-cell pattern 1) were further filtered for DNA-binding and RNA-binding factors, that are reported in this pathway.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3527).",
