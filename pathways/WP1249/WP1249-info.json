    "description": "The erythropoietin receptor is a 66 kDa peptide and is a member of the cytokine receptor family. The receptor is tyrosine phosphorylated upon binding by erythropoietin and associates with and activates the tyrosine kinase, JAK2, which activates different intracellular pathways including: Ras/MAP kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and STAT transcription factors. The stimulated erythropoietin receptor appears to have a role in erythroid cell survival. Defects in the erythropoietin receptor may produce erythroleukemia and familial erythrocytosis.
