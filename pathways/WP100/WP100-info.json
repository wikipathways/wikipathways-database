    "description": "Glutathione is a major antioxidant in all forms of life and an indicator of cellular oxidative stress. Reduction by the GSR enzyme utilizes NADPH as an electron donor. In a reduced form, glutathione is metabolized in multiple ways leading to the biosynthesis of mercapturonate, glutamate, glycine, cysteine and other amino acids.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP100)",
