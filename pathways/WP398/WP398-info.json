    "description": "Trehalose is a storage carbohydrate that can either be synthesized or obtained from the external environment. To be utilized as a carbon source, trehalase (EC:3.2.1.28) must convert trehalose and water into two molecules of glucose. S. cerevisiae has two trehalase enzymes, one is an acid trehalase encoded by ATH1 and the other is a neutral trehalase encoded by NTH1. The name \"acid\" or \"neutral\" are based on the optimal pH of each enzyme (pH 4.5-5.0 and pH 6.8-7.0, respectively).",
