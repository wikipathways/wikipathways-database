    "description": "Small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) is a highly malignant cancer of the lung.  Genes altered in small cell lung carcinoma: * TP53 is mutated in 70-90% of SCLCs.  * RB1 is inactivated in most SCLCs.  * PTEN is mutated in 2-10% of SCLCs.  * MYC amplifications and amplification of MYC family members is found in 30% of SCLCs.  * FHIT protein expression is lost due to Loss of heterozygocity (LOH) on chromosome arm 3p found in more than 80% of SCLCs.

Phosphorylation sites were added based on information from PhosphoSitePlus (R), www.phosphosite.org.",
