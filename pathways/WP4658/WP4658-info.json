    "description": "Small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) is a highly malignant cancer of the lung.  Genes altered in small cell lung carcinoma: 1. TP53 is mutated in 70-90% of SCLCs.  2. RB1 is inactivated in most SCLCs.  3. PTEN is mutated in 2-10% of SCLCs.  4. MYC amplifications and amplification of MYC family members is found in 30% of SCLCs.  5. FHIT protein expression is lost due to loss of heterozygocity (LOH) on chromosome arm 3p found in more than 80% of SCLCs.

Phosphorylation sites were added based on information from PhosphoSitePlus (R), www.phosphosite.org.",
