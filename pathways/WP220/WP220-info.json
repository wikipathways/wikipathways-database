    "description": "The deoxynucleotides required for DNA synthesis can either be made de novo, or they can be salvaged from endogenous degradation processes. If the required substrates are available, the salvage pathways of pyrimidine deoxyribonucleotides are preferred over de novo synthesis pathways for pyrimidine biosynthesis. As with many of the metabolic pathways of S. cerevisiae, the pathways for the salvage of pyrimidine deoxyribonucleotides are regulated by a variety of processes, including transcription regulation.
