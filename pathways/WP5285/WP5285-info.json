Various factors are secreted in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) that can either stimulate or inhibit PDAC development. Alteration of PDAC development by immune cells can be direct and/or indirect.  Used cell name abbreviations: MDSC = myeloid-derived suppressor cell, Treg = regulatory T cell, CAF = cancer associated fibroblast, PSC = pancreatic stellate cell, Th = CD4+ T helper cell.",
