    "description": "Neuroinflammation is inflammation specific to parts of the central nervous system. It can be triggered by external or internal factors, such as UV damage, inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress. Stress on the cell leads to activation of inflammatory response pathways that involve several transcription factors such as AP-1 and NFkB, which will lead to the transcription of several proteins and/or cytokines.",
