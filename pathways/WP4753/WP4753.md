description: Nucleotide excision repair is a DNA repair mechanism that repairs DNA
  damaged by UV radiation.  This type of damage produces bulky distortions in the
  shape of DNA double helix due to the addition of DNA adducts, mostly thymine dimers
  and 6,4-photoproducts.  Recognition of distortions leads to the removal of a short
  single-stranded DNA segment that includes the lesion, creating a single-strand gap
  in the DNA, which is subsequently filled in by DNA polymerase, which uses the undamaged
  strand as a template. NER can be divided into two subpathways (Global genomic NER
  and Transcription coupled NER) that differ only in their recognition of helix-distorting
  DNA damage. Nucleotide excision repair has more complexity in eukaryotes.   Nucleotide
  excision repair (NER) is a particularly important DNA repair mechanism as evidenced
  by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins
  including Xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome.  This pathway was adapted
  from [KEGG](https://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?pathway+hsa03420), [REPAIRtoire](http://repairtoire.genesilico.pl/Pathway/2/)
  and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide_excision_repair). The pathway
  layout is based on KEGG.
