    "description": "Sucrose is synthesized from the precursors UDP-glucose and fructose 6-phosphate, which are converted into sucrose 6-phosphate by the enzyme sucrose-6-phosphate synthase. Sucrose 6-phosphate is then dephosphorylated by sucrose phosphatase, resulting in the formation of sucrose, which can be exported to other tissues. Although the reaction catalyzed by sucrose 6-phosphate synthase is energetically unfavorable, the hydrolysis of sucrose 6-phosphate to sucrose is highly exergonic, driving the overall synthesis of sucrose in an essentially irreversible manner.",
