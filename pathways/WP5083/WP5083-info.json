    "description": "This pathway shows the relation between neuroinflammation and glutamatergic signaling. Pre-synaptic neurons release glutamate, which acts on various receptors (kainate, metabotropic, AMPA and NMDA), thereby regulating LTP, LDP, neuronal survival and proliferation. Glutamate retro-signaling negatively regulates its exocytotic release. The remainder of glutamate is taken up by astrocytes through EAAT1-4. Glutamine is generated from blood-derived glucose, transported to pre-synaptic neurons and converted into glutamate. Alternatively, glucose is converted into D-serine, which functions as co-agonist for NMDARs and is broken down by DAAO. CNS inflammation induces M1 and M2 microglia, which modulate neuronal and astrocyte function.",
