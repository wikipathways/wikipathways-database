    "description": "Neolacto series glycosphingolipid bisynthesis.The neolacto series are derived from lactosylceramides (abbreviated as LacCer), which are a class of glycosphingolipids connecting a ceramide lipid to a sugar group. These lipids can have various biological functions that we are not aware of at the moment. Silencing of the B3GNT5 gene was found to lead to various issues in mouse models, including preimplantation lethality, early death, growth inhibition, loss of fur, obesity, reproductive problems, and B-cell functional defects.
