    "description": "This pathway is inspired by the [Lipidmaps>Eicosanoids Pathway expended pathway display](https://lipidmaps.org/pathway/pathways_maps). Eicosanoids are a large group of compounds metabolised from arachidonic acid (AA), either via cyclooxygenases (COX) [WP4347](https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP4347), lipooxygenases(LOX) [WP4348](https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP4348), or cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYP) [WP4349](https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP4349). This pathway visualises the second route, via LOX. ",
