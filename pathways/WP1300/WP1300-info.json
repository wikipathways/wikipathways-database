    "description": "Aflatoxins are naturally occurring [mycotoxins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycotoxin) that are produced by many species of [Aspergillus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspergillus), a [fungus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus), most notably [Aspergillus flavus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspergillus_flavus) and [Aspergillus parasiticus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspergillus_parasiticus). After entering the body, aflatoxins are metabolized by the liver to a reactive intermediate, aflatoxin M<sub>1<\/sub>, an [epoxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoxide). Aflatoxin B1 is considered the most toxic and is produced by both Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus.  Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aflatoxin)",
