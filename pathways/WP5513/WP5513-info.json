    "description": "Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) work by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase enzymes PTGS1 (COX-1) and PTGS2 (COX-2), with different NSAIDs showing varying selectivity for the COX-2 isoform.  This inhibition blocks the conversion of arachidonic acid into prostaglandins (PGs).  Inspired by Figure 1 in PMID:32322101.",
