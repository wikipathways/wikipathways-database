description: This AOP outlines how ACE-2 plays a detrimental role in causing fibrotic
  damage to the lung by influencing various factors such as fibrogenic components,
  proinflammatory cytokines, and a lack of oxygen. When the activity of ACE2 is suppressed,
  the conversion of Ang II into Ang-(1-7) is not properly facilitated. Consequently,
  the levels of proinflammatory Ang II rise, while the levels of anti-inflammatory
  Ang-(1-7) decrease. Notably, ACE2 inhibition has been observed to raise the levels
  of Ang II peptides, which are a ligand for the type 1 angiotensin receptor (AT1R).
  This phenomenon is considered a significant risk factor for lung fibrosis, vasoconstriction,
  endothelial dysfunction, and cell death.
