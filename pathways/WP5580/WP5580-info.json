    "description": "In decidual NK (dNK) cells, killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) interact with HLA-C allotypes on extravillous trophoblast (EVT) cells to modulate immune responses at the maternal\u2013fetal interface. Inhibitory KIRs transmit signals through immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs), which recruit SHP-1 and SHP-2 phosphatases to suppress activation pathways. Conversely, activating KIRs signal via the adaptor protein DAP12, whose ITAM motifs recruit SYK kinase, leading to downstream activation of LAT, SLP-76, VAV1, PLC-γ1, and NF-κB. This cascade promotes cytokine production and functional activation of dNK cells.  Additionally, KIR signaling has been linked to ribosomal protein-linked (RPL) pathways, suggesting coordination between immune signaling and translational regulation in dNK-mediated placental development.",
