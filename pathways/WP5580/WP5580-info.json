    "description": "In decidual NK (dNK) cells, killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) interact with HLA-C allotypes on extravillous trophoblast (EVT) cells to modulate immune responses at the maternal\u2013fetal interface. Inhibitory KIRs transmit signals through immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs), which recruit SHP-1 and SHP-2 phosphatases to suppress activation pathways. Conversely, activating KIRs signal via the adaptor protein DAP12, whose ITAM motifs recruit SYK kinase, leading to downstream activation of LAT, SLP-76, VAV1, PLC-γ1, and NF-κB. This cascade promotes cytokine production and functional activation of dNK cells. Additionally, KIR signaling has been linked to repeated pregnancy loss (RPL), suggesting coordination between immune signaling and placental development mediated by dNK cells. The exact origin of dNK cells (phenotype CD56\u207a\u207a (bright) CD16\u207b) is still uncertain. Some studies suggest they may arise from CD34\u207a progenitor cells, while others propose that peripheral blood NK (pbNK) cells or local NK precursors give rise to uterine NK (uNK) cells. These uNK cells may then differentiate into either endometrial NK (eNK) cells, which are present before pregnancy, or decidual NK (dNK) cells, which appear during early pregnancy.",
