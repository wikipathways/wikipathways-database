    "description": "The pathway of L-isoleucine biosynthesis from L-threonine is a five-step pathway that shares several steps with the pathway of L-valine biosynthesis (https://www.wikipathways.org/pathways/WP2.html). These entwined pathways are part of the superpathway of branched chain amino acid biosynthesis, that generates not only L-isoleucine and L-valine, but also L-leucine.
