    "description": "This pathway is a concise and simplified version of the basic proteins involved in angiogenesis. The proces is regulated by hyopoxia, which results in the transcription of eg. VEGF1, FGF2, PDGFbeta, MMP9, MMP2 and Ang1. These proteins bind to their receptors and by doing this they initiate different pathways that result in vessel formation.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP1539).",
