    "description": "SIM1 is the only gene found in the region 6q12 (chr6:100,836,750-100,911,811). A deletion or loss of function results in developmental delay and neuropsyschiatric disorders as well as severe obesity. SIM1 is a transcription factor responsible for several processes in neurogenesis and is stimulated by the leptin-melanocortin pathway. ",
