    "description": "This pathway provides an overview of all active transport that occurs in the proximal tubule of the nephron in the kidneys. The proximal tubule plays roles in regulating the pH of the filtrate, secreting organic waste, and reabsorption of NaCl, a large variety of solutes, and amino acids from the filtrate back into the circulation. The apical side indicates the proximal tubule which contains the filtrate after passing through Bowman's capsule, which later becomes the urine after passing through the complete nephron, from which solutes are reabsorbed (taken back into the body) and into which waste is secreted. Impaired ability of reabsorption by the proximal tubule can lead to Fanconi syndrome.",
