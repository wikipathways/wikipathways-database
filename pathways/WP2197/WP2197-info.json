    "description": "Endothelin-1 is a bicyclic 21 amino acid peptide, produced primarily in the endothelium. It is a potent stimulus of long-lasting and persistent vasoconstriction. It also has a role as a stimulus of inflammation, oxidative stress and cellular proliferation.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2197 CPTAC Assay Portal]",
