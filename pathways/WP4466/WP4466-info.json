    "description": "This pathway represents biology relevant to glutathione, including biosynthesis, metabolism, redox cycle, uptake, glutathionylation and acivicin inhibition.  Glutathione is an antioxidant that is synthesized in eukaryotes from L-cysteine, L-glutamic acid, and glycine in a two-step process involving gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase and glutathione synthetase. Glutathione prevents cellular damage by acting as an electron donor to neutralize reactive oxygen species. Reactive glutathione is produced, which then reacts with another reactive glutathione molecule to produce glutathione disulfide, GSSG. It was based partly on [WP164](https://www.wikipathways.org/pathways/WP164.html) and [WP1770](https://www.wikipathways.org/pathways/WP1770.html), with information added from literature.  This pathway was created as a part of [Mendiola et cl](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-020-0654-0), pictured in fig 5.",
