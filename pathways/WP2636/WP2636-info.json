    "description": "The pathway was modeled after Figure 2 in Li, et al. 2008 and is based on the common pathways identified in their study as well as protein interaction data. Specifically, glutamate and dopamine neuroactive ligand-receptor interactions trigger long-term potentiation, MAPK and GnRH signaling and gap junction regulation (green outlined pathway nodes). Related functional modules such as depolarization, gene expression and cytoskeleton regulation are also indicated (non-outlined pathway nodes). Among the several positive feedback loops identified in this pathway, the authors highlighted fast and slow ones in red and blue, respectively.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2636).",
