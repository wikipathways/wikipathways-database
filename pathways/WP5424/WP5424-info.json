    "description": "Oxylipins, notably prostaglandins, are synthetized by senescent cells and then accumulate, promoting the senescent-associated secretory phenotype (Wiley et al., 2021). Prostaglandins are classified into three main groups, depending on the starting point of their biosynthesis. Series-1 prostaglandins are derived from its precursor dihomo-Î³-linolenic acid (DGLA). Series-2 prostaglandins and series-3 prostaglandins are derived from arachidonic acid (AA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), respectively (Noverr et al., 2003)",
