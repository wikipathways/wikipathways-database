    "description": "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) affects 13% of Americans aged 40 and older.  It degrades vision and, if severe, causes blindness. It is marked by the degeneration of photoreceptor cells and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), leading to distinct atrophic areas in the macula.  Individuals with geographic atrophy often experience a slow and painless decline in central vision.  This makes it difficult to read, recognize faces, or do other tasks that need good vision.  Inspired by Figure 3 in [Rajanala et al. (2023)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11182118).",
