    "description": "Schematic summarizing predicted miR-517a relationships with ARCN1 and USP1.  A genomewide miRNA mimic toxicity screen indicates common and selective vulnerabilities of epithelial ovarian cancer cells. miR-517a targets a common vulnerability, primarily via its target ARCN1.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3596 CPTAC).",
