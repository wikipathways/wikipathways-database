    "description": "Under aerobic conditions, S. cerevisiae is able to utilize glycerol as a sole carbon and energy source. Glycerol degradation is a two-step process; the first step of glycerol phosphorylation occurs in the cytosol, then glycerol-3-phosphate enters the mitochondrion where the second step of conversion to dihydroxyacetone is catalyzed. Dihydroxyacetone is then returned to the cytosol where it enters into either glycolysis or gluconeogenesis. The genes encoding the enzymes catalyzing glycerol catabolism, GUT1 and GUT2, are carbon source regulated; gene expression is repressed when cells are grown on fermentable carbon sources such as glucose and up-regulated on non-fermentable carbon sources such as glycerol or ethanol.
