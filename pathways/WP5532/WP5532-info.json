    "description": "RLBP1 encodes CRALBP, a cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein that functions as a soluble retinoid carrier in the visual cycle of the eye. Mutations in RLBP1 are linked to recessively inherited conditions, such as Bothnia dystrophy, retinitis pigmentosa, retinitis punctata albescens, fundus albipunctatus, and Newfoundland rod-cone dystrophy.",
