    "description": "Galanin, a 29-30 amino acid neuropeptide named to be so, as a glycine residue occupies the position at N-terminal and an alanine residue at C-terminal. Galanin is expressed in the central and peripheral nervous systems in mammals. The galanin family of peptides includes GMAP (galanin message associated peptide), GALP (galanin-like peptide), and its splice variant alarin along with galanin. There are three known G-protein coupled receptor subtypes of galanin: GALR1, GALR2, and GALR3. Galaninergic signaling is predominantly inhibitory which mainly involves MAPK, AKT, and AC pathways. Galanin peptides have a wide range of non-neuronal functions as well as classic neuromodulatory roles, so they are often considered regulatory peptides. Galanin in general is associated with several biological functions such as arousal and sleep regulation, nociception, learning, inflammation, feeding, and neuroendocrine regulation. It is also implicated in diseases like Alzheimer's, depression, epilepsy, mood disorders, stress, anxiety, diabetes mellitus, and chronic pain.  The creation of this pathway is described in [Gopalakrishnan et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33136286/).",
