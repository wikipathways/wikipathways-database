    "description": "This pathway was adapted from several resources and is designed to provide a theoretical frame-work for examining Wnt signaling and interacting components in the context of embryonic stem-cell pluripotency and self-renewal.  A central organizing theme of this pathway are known drug targets which promote self-renewal or pluripotency (BIO and IQ-1)  and implicated upstream regulators of the core pluripotency transcriptional components (e.g. Nanog).  It should be noted  that it is unclear whether all the depicted components participate in this pathway in human embryonic stem cells.  Interactions and object/gene groups for the pathway exist for the majority of components. ",
