    "description": "The activation and translocation of transcription factors NFAT, AP-1 and NF-kappa-B via the co-stimulatory signaling cascade triggered by MHC peptide, B7 proteins and PD-L1. The activation of NFAT involves a Ca2+/calcineurin disruption of a massive RNA-protein complex prior to its translocation into the nucleus and ultimate transcription factor activity.",
