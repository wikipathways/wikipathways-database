    "description": "Biosynthesis of steroid hormone precursors. The enzymes responsible for this process are mainly cytochrome P450 (Cyps), hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSDs), and steroid reductases, converting cholesterol to several classes of steroid hormones such as glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, progestins, androgens, and estrogens. these reactions take place in various organs, e.g. adrenal gland, testis, ovary, brain, placenta, and adipose tissue [PMID:16807284].  The pathway knowledge depicted in this model stems from William Griffths.  Metabolic reactions currently without a Rhea ID have been added in bold to the pathway model. ",
