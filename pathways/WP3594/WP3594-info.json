    "description": "This is currently not a pathway but a list of circadian rhythm related genes and proteins. The source for this information is the gene ontology. The genes and proteins were filtered for \"circadian rhythm\" annotation (taxon = homo sapiens). According to supplementary information they were clustered in major (neurotransmitters, hormons, appetite regulation and immune system) and minor groups.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3594).",
