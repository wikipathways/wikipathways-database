    "description": "Signaling lipids (SLs) play a crucial role in various signaling pathways, featuring diverse lipid backbone structures. Emerging evidence showing the biological significance and biomedical values of SLs has strongly spurred the advancement of analytical approaches aimed at profiling SLs.The platform enables analyses of 260 metabolites covering oxylipins (isoprostanes, prostaglandins and other oxidized lipids), free fatty acids, lysophospholipids, sphingoid bases (C16, C18), platelet activating factors (C16, C18), endocannabinoids and bile acids",
