    "description": "Neural crest cells migrate and invade as part of normal development, but also as part of neuroblastoma metastasis in cancer. Many of the same growth factors, receptors and signaling pathways are involved. The participation of NTRK2 (TrkB), KIDINS220, and SORT1 (Sortilin) appear to be unique to the cancer signaling case, as well as the role for the intracellular domain fragment of NGFR (NGFR-ICD or p75ICD). Also see the closely related pathway, \"Neural crest cells during development\" ([WP4564](https://www.wikipathways.org/instance/Pathway:WP4564)).",
