    "description": "Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is an IL-7-like cytokine involved in regulation of a broad spectrum of biological processes. The TSLP receptor complex consists of the IL-7 receptor alpha subunit and its unique TSLPR subunit (gene symbol CRLF2). TSLP can be secreted by epithelial cells upon pathogen stimulation. TSLP can also activate dendritic cells, CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells. TSLP not only activate the JAK/STAT pathway but also induce phosphorylation of other signaling molecules including PI3K/Akt, ERK1/2 and JNKs. Aberrant TSLP signaling is implicated in a number of the development of diseases, including asthma, atopic dermatitis, eosinophilic eosophagitis and acute lymphoid leukemia.
