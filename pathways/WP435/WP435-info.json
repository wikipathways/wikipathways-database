    "description": "This one-carbon metabolism pathway is centered around folate. Folate is the primary methyl-group donor for processes such as DNA methylation reactions, nucleotide synthesis and DNA repair mechanisms. An important pathway for any study related to folate or DNA methylation.  Differential methylation (e.g. hypermethylation of tumor suppressors) as well as disturbances in nucleotide synthesis and repair, are associated with several forms of cancer. There are also indications that hypermethylation is involved in the progression of adenomas to cancer.  Inferred from human one-carbon metabolism pathway.",
