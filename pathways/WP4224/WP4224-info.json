    "description": "Overview of purine metabolism and related diseases. Disorders resulting from an enzyme defect are highlighted in pink, metabolic markers are highlighted in red. Arrows indicate the directionality of chemical conversions.  On the right, the biosynthesis of IMP is depicted in more detail (adapted from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purine_metabolism). The color scheme for this part of the pathway is as follows: enzymes(black), coenzymes(light orange), regular substrates/metabolites(blue), additional substrates(dark green), metal ions(turquoise), inorganic molecules(light purple).  This pathway was inspired by Ed. 5, Chapter 13 from the book of Blau (Ed. 4 Chapter 41) (ISBN 9783030677268). A similar version without the disorders and with biomarkers visualised with arrows can be found [https://www.wikipathways.org/instance/WP4792 here].  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP4224 CPTAC Assay Portal]",
