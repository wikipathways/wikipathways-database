    "description": "Congenital hypothyroidism is a genetic hormonal disorder regarding the thyroid hormone. Due dyshormonogenesis, the production of the thyroid hormones is impaired resulting in increased birth weight, reduced LDL breakdown, decreased lipolysis, impaired glucose metabolism and decreased body temperature. Above, an overview of thyroid hormones production occurring in thyroid gland and their relevant downstream signalling is displayed. As the legend states, genes known te be affected by mutations leading to congenital hypothyroidism are colored red.",
