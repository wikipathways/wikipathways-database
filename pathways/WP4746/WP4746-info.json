    "description": "Congenital hypothyroidism is a genetic hormonal disorder of the thyroid hormone. Due to dyshormonogenesis, the production of the thyroid hormones is impaired resulting in increased birth weight, reduced LDL breakdown, decreased lipolysis, impaired glucose metabolism and decreased body temperature. This pathway diagram shows an overview of thyroid hormones production in thyroid gland and their relevant downstream signaling. Genes affected by mutations leading to congenital hypothyroidism are colored red.",
