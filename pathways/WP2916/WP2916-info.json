    "description": "A proposed interactome of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), based on proteomics. PRC2 has histone methyltransferase activity and primarily trimethylates histone H3 on lysine 27, a mark of transcriptionally silent chromatin, and is required for initial targeting of genomic region (PRC Response Elements or PRE) to be silenced. Based on figure 1B in [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20064376 Shen et al].",
