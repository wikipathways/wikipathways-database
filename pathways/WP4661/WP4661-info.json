    "description": "This pathway was created based on findings from the bachelor thesis project by Kristin Koppelmaa which investigated vitamin D GWAS results.  Thesis DOI: [10.6084/m9.figshare.8796710.v1](https://figshare.com/articles/From_SNPs_to_Pathways_Functional_Interpretation_of_Vitamin_D_GWAS_Results/8796710). This pathway shows an excerpt of the WikiPathways amino acid metabolism (WP3925) pathway containing the segment between the metabolites histidine and glutamate that was extended. The proteins added to the conversion were AMDHD1 and UROC1. Although the HAL and FTCD proteins were included in the amino acid metabolism pathway previously, the lead SNP rs7487782 which exists in both HAL and AMDHD1, was added to the pathway and linked to these two genes. This variant was mapped to these genes during the analysis of a dataset originating from PMID: [29343764](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29343764).",
