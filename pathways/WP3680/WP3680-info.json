    "description": "This pathway is based on Figure 8 of \"Mapping drug physico-chemical features to pathway activity reveals molecular networks linked to toxicity outcome.\"(See bibliography).   These 3 pathways demonstrate close links between pathways associated with chemical hits and pathways associated with toxicity. The pathways associated with chemical hits (Wnt signaling, long-term depression, and ErbB signaling pathways) and the pathways associated with toxicity (focal adhesion, ALS, and pancreatic Cancer respectively) have been shown to have possible links through shared genes between the two pathways. The mechanisms of action presented by these links were only implied by the toxicity pathways.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3680).",
