    "description": "CaMKK2 is a 66Ã¢â\u201a¬â\u20acœ68-kDa serine kinase, consists of unique N- and C-terminal domains and a central Ser/Thr-directed kinase domain that is followed by a regulatory domain composed of overlapping autoinhibitory and CaM-binding regions (PMID:9335539). CAMKK2 is activated once calmodulin (CALM1) binds with CAAMKK2. The most well-characterized substrates of CaMKK2 are CaMKI, CaMKIV and AMPKÃŽÂ±. CaMKK2 phosphorylates CaMKIV, CaMKI and AMPKÃŽÂ± on activation loop Thr residues (Thr-200, Thr-177 and Thr-172, respectively), which increases their kinase activities (PMID:9822657). CaMKK2 is present in many areas of the brain, including the olfactory bulb, hippocampus, dentate gyrus, amygdala, hypothalamus, and cerebellum (PMID:9822657, 12654522). The creation of this pathway is described in [Najar et al](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33136287/).",
