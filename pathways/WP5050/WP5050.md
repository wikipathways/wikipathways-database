description: Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) is a central enzyme in relation to the TCA
  cycle, as it converts pyruvate into acetyl-CoA. Its activity favours TCA cycle activity.
  PDH is downregulated by PDH kinase (PDK) and upregulated by PDH phosphatase (PDP).
  PDK and PDP are respectively down and upregulated in OIS, in particular in the case
  of the oncogene BRAFV600E (James et al., 2015; Wiley & Campisi, 2016). Due to these
  regulatory mechanisms, PDH is a crucial mediator of OIS for TCA activity.  Malic
  enzyme (ME) is another crucial enzyme in the TCA cycle. There appears to be a reciprocal
  regulation between p53 and ME, mediated through AMPK activation. Downregulation
  of ME leads to p53-mediated induction of senescence, while upregulation can suppress
  it (Jiang et al., 2013; Wiley & Campisi, 2016). Because ME uses NAD+/NADP+ and produces
  NADH/NADPH, downregulation of the enzyme also affects NADPH-dependent mechanisms,
  including antioxidant defenses. This in turn can cause accumulation of reactive
  oxygen species (ROS), which activate p53 through AMPK and cause senescence (Wiley
  & Campisi, 2016).  In OIS, accumulation of TCA intermediates has been observed,
  including alpha-ketoglutarate, citrate and malate (Kaplon et al., 2013). Further
  research showed that increased alpha-ketoglutarate has an effect on transcriptional
  regulation (Salama et al., 2014).  Lipids are also part of the input of the TCA
  cycle, and fatty acid oxidation has been observed to increase in OIS (Sabbatinelli
  et al., 2019).  Malate dehydrogenase (MDH1) also plays an important role in the
  TCA cycle and is part of the malate-aspartate shuttle. Lower levels of the enzyme
  were observed in DNA-damage induced and proliferative exhaustion-induced senescent
  cells. Downregulation of MDH1 also affects the NAD+/NADH ratio, known to be related
  to senescence. Other enzymes of the malate-aspartate shuttle also affect this ratio,
  such as the aspartate aminotransferase (GOT1). Factors influencing NAD metabolism
  in senescence have been addressed in more details in https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP5046
