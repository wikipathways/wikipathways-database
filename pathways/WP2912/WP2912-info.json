    "description": "Vascular smooth muscle refers to the particular type of smooth muscle found within, and composing the majority of the wall of blood vessels. The main function of vascular smooth muscle tonus is to regulate the caliber of the blood vessels in the body. Excessive vasoconstriction leads to high blood pressure, while excessive vasodilation as in shock leads to low blood pressure (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_smooth_muscle).",
