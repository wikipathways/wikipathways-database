description: In order to maintain protein homeostasis and cell function, cells are
  constantly synthesizing as well as degrading proteins. This is especially important
  when proteins are misfolded, due to extra- or intracellular stress or a genetic
  mutation, as this is the basis for many diseases. This pathway shows the major events
  which are involved in proteostasis.
