    "description": "Cancer related cachexia is a metabolic disease that is defined by an increased breakdown of muscle protein. Muscle breakdown in cachexia occurs mostly due to activation of either the ubiquitin proteasome system, or the autophagy lysosomal system. In this pathway an overview is presented of the different mechanisms that have been found to activate these two systems involved in muscle degradation.",
