    "description": "Pathways associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Neurodivergent conditions linked in studies to these pathways include ADHD, autism, dyspraxia, dyslexia, dyscalculia, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, sensory processing disorders, and Tourette syndrome.  This aims to be a highly detailed, comprehensive map of the metabolic pathways associated with these disorders, from indicated input vitamins through synthesis to signaling across the synaptic gap, re-uptake, and catabolism receptors.  This pathway is constructed with computational analysis and machine learning in mind.  In cases where there is a trade-off between readability and parametric accuracy, parametric accuracy is prioritized.  This pathway is inspired by Kimberly Kitzerow and [her meta-analysis research](https://kimberly102347.com/the-chart/) on the biomechanisms and pathways behind invisible illnesses.    Pathways included in this map: * One-Carbon (1C), * Metabolism Folate Cycle, * Methionine Cycle, * Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) Pathway, * Neurotransmitter Synthesis, Reuptake, and Breakdown, * Kynurenine Pathway (KP), * Endocannabinoid System (ECS), * Neuroreceptor Dynamics in the Synaptic Cleft, * ROS Reactive Oxygen Stress.",
