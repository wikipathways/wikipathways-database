    "description": "Pathways associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Neurodivergent conditions linked in studies to these pathways include ADHD, autism, dyspraxia, dyslexia, dyscalculia, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, sensory processing disorders, and Tourette syndrome.  This aims to be a highly detailed, comprehensive map of the metabolic pathways associated with these disorders, from indicated input vitamins through synthesis to signaling across the synaptic gap, re-uptake, and catabolism receptors.  This pathway is constructed with computational analysis and machine learning in mind.  In cases where there is a trade-off between readability and parametric accuracy, parametric accuracy is prioritized.  This pathway is inspired by Kimberly Kitzerow and her meta-analysis research on the biomechanisms and pathways behind invisible illnesses.  https://kimberly102347.com/the-chart/   Pathways included in this map: One-Carbon (1C), Metabolism Folate Cycle, Methionine Cycle, Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) Pathway, Neurotransmitter Synthesis, Reuptake, and Breakdown, Kynurenine Pathway (KP), Endocannabinoid System (ECS), Neuroreceptor Dynamics in the Synaptic Cleft, ROS Reactive Oxygen Stress.",
