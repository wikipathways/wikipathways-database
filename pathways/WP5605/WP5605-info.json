    "description": "The human β-like globin gene cluster is shown together with the five DNase-hypersensitive sites of the locus control region (LCR) super-enhancer. The LCR regulates developmental expression by sequentially interacting with different globin genes during embryonic, fetal, and adult stages. A schematic of the transcription-factor complex that promotes LCR looping to the adult globin genes is also included. Genomic coordinates correspond to the GRCh38 assembly.  Inspired by figure 1 in [Vasiloudis et al. 2025](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12249674/).",
