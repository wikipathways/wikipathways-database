    "description": "Summary of findings for miR-509-3p and the YAP1/ECM axis. [Reference](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5041955/). Collectively, the results suggest that miR-509-3p-mediated changes in levels of YAP1 and ECM genes impair migration, invasion, and spheroid formation and so may attenuate metastatic progression in advanced stage ovarian cancer. Further, results suggest that the direct downstream miR-509-3p target YAP1 is likely a critical driver of cellular migration and spheroid formation in ovarian cancers in which levels of YAP1 protein are high.   Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3967).",
