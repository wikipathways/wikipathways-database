    "description": "Glucocorticoid biosynthesis; a very complex multistep process starting from cholesterol in the inner mitochondrial membrane through StAR and StAR-related proteins. Glucocorticoid metabolites are essential in immune system regulation through the glucocorticoid receptor. Most of these compounds are produces in the adrenal gland, however can also be produced in other tissues, e.g. skin, brain, intestine [PMID:32203088].  The pathway knowledge depicted in this model stems from William Griffiths.  Metabolic reactions currently without a Rhea ID have been added in bold to the pathway model. ",
