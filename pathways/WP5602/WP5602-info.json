    "description": "Caffeine acts as a competitive antagonist at adenosine receptors -- particularly the A\u2081 and A\u2082A subtypes -- thereby promoting wakefulness and modifying the activity of key neurotransmitters, including dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and serotonin, within the central nervous system.  Inspired by [Figure 1 in Kumar and Lipshultz, 2019](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6915633).",
