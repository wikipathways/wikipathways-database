    "description": "This is pathway is an illustration for pathanatos. Parthanatos is a cell death signaling pathway in which excessive oxidative damage to DNA leads to over-activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). PARP then generates the formation of large poly(ADP-ribose) polymers that induce the release of apoptosis-inducing factor from the outer mitochondrial membrane.",
