description: An organism-level overview of Glucose homeostasis. At this moment the
  focus is on metabolites that can be measured in the plasma, but it would be nice
  to show the interaction between the different organs (Adipose tissue, Liver, Intestine,
  Muscle) as well as the involvement of hormones other than insulin
