    "description": "Cholesterol is synthesized via a cascade of enzymatic reactions known as the mevalonate pathway. This series of reactions is primarily regulated by a rate-limiting step involving the conversion of hydroxyl-methyl glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) into mevalonate. In this pathway multiple diseases and disorders involving the cholesterol synthesis are included and its role depicted in the pathway.",
