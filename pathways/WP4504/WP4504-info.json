    "description": "This pathway visualizes the conversion of methionine to cysteine, after which it is further metabolized in either an oxidative or non-oxidative manner. Several of these metabolites are altered in people suffering from MoCD and SO; changes in metabolite concentrations (comparing MoCD cases to controls) are highlighted in blue (see [WP4507](https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP4507) for the pathway on MoCD). This pathway was inspired by Chapter 12 of the book of Blau (ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361)). ",
