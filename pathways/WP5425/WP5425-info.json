    "description": "The T-2 (also T2) toxin is a cause of food poisoning. Metabolisation to HT-2 is reported as a detoxification mechanism in mammals. This pathway describes the mycotoxin metabolism pathway of T-2 in wheat with putative biotransformation products. Compounds were converted into identifiers using the 2D drawings in Figure 4 from Nathanail et al. 2015. Structure elucidation is detailed in Meng-Reiterer et al. 2015.",
