    "description": "This pathway is modeled after Figure 1 in the article \" ATR signalling: more than meeting at the fork\" (See Bibliography). This pathway details the ATR signaling which commences when there is a gap in the single strand DNA. It details the usage of several independent checkpoint proteins which then cause TOPBP1 dependent activation of the phosphorylation and kinase of a large number of substrates including CHK1 to commence regulation of cellular response to DNA damage and replication stress.   Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3875)",
