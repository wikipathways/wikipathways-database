    "description": "This pathway was created using the GPCRDB (Horn et al., 1998), http://www.gpcr.org/7tm/ (originally at http://www.cmbi.kun.nl/7tm/). The groupings are based on the GPCR phylogenetic tree available from the GPCRDB and the training sets used by Karchin et al. (Bioinformatics, 2002, pg. 147-159). The labels indicate children and grandchildren of the various classes of GPCRs as described by these references.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP117)",
