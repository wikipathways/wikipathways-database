description: This pathway shows the activation of multiple signaling pathways involved
  in kidney fibrosis, starting from an insult like HIV infection or oxidative stress,
  through the suppression of SIAH1 and increased expression of HIPK2. This pathway
  was adapted from Figure 6i of [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22406746/ Jin et.
  al.]
