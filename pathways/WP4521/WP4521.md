description: Glycosylation is the most common postranslational modification. Defects
  in this pathway lead to autosomal recessive disorders, called congenital disorders
  of glycosylation (CDG). Up to date about 50 CDGs have been identified and more are
  expected to be discovered. This category of metabolic disorders can be divided into
  four basic groups depending on where the glycosylation process occurs on the molecule.
  The depicts pathway depicts the group of N-glycosylation. Generally, N-glycosylation
  processes spread over three cellular compartments - cytosol, endoplasmic reticulum
  and Golgi apparatus. The associated mortality rate  in combination with the limited
  treatment options for CDG, points out the relevance for further investigations of
  this pathway. Disorders resulting from an enzyme defect are highlighted in pink.
  This pathway was inspired by Chapter 30 of the book of Blau (ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361)).
