description: Benekareddy et al observed the phenomenon that rats who were maternally separated show increased levels of induced anxiety-related behaviour during adulthood. Type 2 serotonin receptors have been implicated in anxiety related behaviour and may be suitable targets for reducing anxiety response. Benekareddy et al report that treatment with ketanserin (a serotonergic antagonist) during postnatal life blocked the long-lasting effects of maternal separation on anxiety behavior in the open field test and the elevated plus maze. Immediate Early Genes such as Arc have been found to be significantly affected in expression (Benekareddy et al). The downstream and upstream gene products of Arc were partly elucidated and presented in a pathway.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3947 CPTAC Assay Portal]
