    "description": "Signaling pathway of the Hepatocyte Growth Factor Receptor (Homo sapiens) also know as C-Met. The C-Met activation results in the stimulation of a variety of intracellular signalling pathways, which regulate several processes such as: motility, migration, proliferation and invasion.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP313).",
