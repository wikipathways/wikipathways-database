    "description": "Pleural mesothelioma (PM) is a rare type of cancer affecting the mesothelial cells of the lungs. 80% of the patients have been exposed to asbestos before being diagnosed, but only 5% of the people exposed to asbestos develop mesothelioma.   Through a literature study and community workshop, several pathways have been identified to contribute to the development of the disease, which are captured in this PM pathway. Frequently mutated genes are highlighted in bold, where red nodes indicate tumor suppressor genes, and yellow indicates oncogenes.  This pathway has been published in Frontiers in Oncology: https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2022.849640 ",
