    "description": "The Wnt/Beta-catenin pathway mediates the transcription of proteins important for maintenance and growth of hematopoietic stem cells. The inhibition of Wnt leads to protein degradation through Beta-Catenin activation by the Axin/APC/CK1/GSK3B protein complex. This pathway is based on figure 5 from Misaghian et al.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3658).",
