    "description": "The adult hippocampus generates new neurons in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus.  Type 1 neural stem cells (NSCs) undergo asymmetric division to generate type 2 progenitor cells (subtypes 2a and 2b), which further differentiate into type 3 cells or neuroblasts.  These neuroblasts then mature into immature neurons, eventually developing into fully mature granule cells.  The lower panel shows the timeframes during which Wnt ligands, Frizzled (FZD) receptors, co-receptors, downstream Wnt signaling pathways, and Wnt target genes are active (refer to main text for specifics). Abbreviations: DG: dentate gyrus, ML: molecular layer, GCL: granule cell layer, SGZ: subgranular zone.  Inspired by Figure 1 in [Arredondo](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7525004/).",
