    "description": "In S. cerevisiae cells, the amino group of glutamate and the amide group of glutamine are the source of nitrogen for all other macromolecules. In order to provide ammonia for the synthesis of glutamine during growth on glutamate-yielding nitrogen sources, cells degrade glutamate into ammonia. The main pathway for S. cerevisiae glutamate degradation is catalyzed by the NAD dependent glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH2).   Description adapted from on [yeastgenome.org](https://pathway.yeastgenome.org/).",
