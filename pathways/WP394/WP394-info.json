    "description": "RNA interference (RNAi) refers to the silencing of gene expression by the overexpression of sequence-specific RNA molecules. This process is associated with a cellular and nuclear defense mechanism used to combat molecular parasites such as transposons and viruses. In addition, RNA interference has been shown to play a regulatory role in development. Work in C. elegans and other organisms have identified many key regulators and pathways necessary for this process. RNAi has been adapted into a tool for the study of gene function; through the use of RNAi, the expression of a target gene can be inhibited by the reverse engineering of a corresponding dsRNA.",
