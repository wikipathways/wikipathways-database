    "description": "This pathway is modeled after Figure 9 in the article \"Gremlin utilizes canonical and non-canonical TGFB signaling to induce lysyl oxidase (LOX) genes in human trabecular meshwork cells\". Gremlin is enables the TGF-B signaling pathways to oversee LOX and LOXL proteins and also demonstrates that the non-canonical JNK1/2 complex, canonical SMAD, and P38 signaling pathways are involved in this pathway. TGF-B signaling is possible through Gremlin's ability to bock the BMP signaling pathway which inhibits TGF-B receptors.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3874 CPTAC Assay Portal]",
