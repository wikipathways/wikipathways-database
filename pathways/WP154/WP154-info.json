    "description": "Biogenic amines are one of two broad classes of classical neurotransmitters (the other being amino acids) and include: acetylcholine, serotonin, histamine, and the catecholamines epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Synthesis pathways for biogenic amines (in blue) follow solid arrows through enzymatic steps, while degradation steps follow the dashed arrows.
