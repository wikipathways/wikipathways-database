    "description": "Dodecanoate, or lauric acid, is found in the fats and oils of both plants and animals, especially coconut and palm kernel oil. This pathway shows the degradation of dodecanoate leading to beta oxidation. Created by Magali Jaillard, Marijke Vermeer, Michiel Adrieans, Ron Schormans and Chris Evelo.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP206)",
