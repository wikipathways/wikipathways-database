description: 'This pathway shows the variable role of metabolic kinases, PGK1, PKM1
  and KHKC/KHKA, acting as protein kinases. They are able to phosphorylate and thereby
  activate second messenger enzymes, which greatly influence cellular functions. This
  Pathway is based on Figure 1 of the paper "Metabolic Kinases Moonlighting as Protein
  Kinases" PMID: 29463470.'
