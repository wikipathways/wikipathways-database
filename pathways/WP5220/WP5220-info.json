    "description": "This pathway model displays the interactions between KRAS and TP53 mutations and pancreatic cancer cells. As a consequence of these mutations, the cell undergoes reprogramming of glucose, lipid and amino acid metabolism, thereby affecting the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The pathway curation is largely based on Figure 2 of the review article by Wang et al. in 2021 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41392-021-00659-4).",
