    "description": "The 2q11.2 copy number variation syndrome can result in the loss of up to 27 protein-coding genes. Patients with 2q11.2 deletions were reported to have developmental delay, speech delay and ADHD, while subjects with 2q11.2 duplications apart from developmental delay had gastroesophageal reflux and short stature (DOI: 10.1002/ajmg.a.37269).",
