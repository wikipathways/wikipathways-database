    "description": "Viral pathogen RNA are recognized by host helicases called RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) that include DDX58 (RIG-I), DHX58 (LGP2), IFIH1 (MDA5), SNW1, and DDX17. These RLR proteins then go on to initiate signaling pathways, triggering the innate antiviral response via production of type I interferons and inflammatory cytokines. RLR pathway genes are characterized by rapid evolution, viral protein interactions, limited sets of protein domains, specific TF regulation, and densely connected interaction networks. The study by van der Lee et al. (2015) identfied novel components, DDX17 and SNW1, for the RIG-I pathway.   Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3865)",
