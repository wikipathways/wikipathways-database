Based on figure 6c in [Leung et al](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25277212). Phosphorylation sites were added based on information from PhosphoSitePlus (R), www.phosphosite.org.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3301).",
