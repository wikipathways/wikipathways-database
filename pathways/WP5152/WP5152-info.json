    "description": "This pathway describes the biogenesis of iron-sulphur clusters. Iron-sulphur clusters bind to proteins and are essential components of respiratory electron transfer complexes as well as many other biological processes.  This pathway was modeled based on Fig 2a from [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18606475/ Rouault and Tong].",
