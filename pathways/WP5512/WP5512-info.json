    "description": "\"Vedolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody with a predominantly gastrointestinal effect. It specifically inhibits leucocyte integrin α4β7, thus preventing its interaction with mucosal vascular addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 (MAdCAM-1), which is involved in the migration of lymphocytes from the blood stream to the intestinal tissue. Vedolizumab is indicated in the treatment of moderate to severe active Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis in adult patients with poor response, loss of response, or intolerance to conventional treatment or to tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) antagonists.\"  Inspired by Figure 1 in https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31470005/.  Vedolizumab is also known by its trade name, Entyvio.",
