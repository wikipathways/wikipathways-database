    "description": "Glutathione is a major antioxidant in all forms of life and an indicator of cellular oxidative stress. Reduction by the GSR enzyme utilizes NADPH as an electron donor. In a reduced form, glutathione is metabolized in multiple ways leading to the biosynthesis of mercapturonate, glutamate, glycine, cysteine and other amino acids.",
