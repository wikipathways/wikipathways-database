Cellular immune miRNAs target important components of the NF-κB signaling pathway at different levels regulating the inflammatory response in the pathogenesis of sepsis. Lower part of the figure illustrates the pathophysiological events in sepsis that lead to tissue injury and subsequent multiple organs failure.",
