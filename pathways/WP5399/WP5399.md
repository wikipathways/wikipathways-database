description: 'Mutations or loss of NPHP1 cause nephronophthisis (NPHP), a rare genetic
  disorder. Due to the involvement of NPHP1 in ciliary function and cellular orientation
  in kidney, the main symptoms of the disorder are found in kidney development and
  function.  Howevre, as in many ciliopathies, neuronal functions are also affected,
  causing psychiatric disorders. '
