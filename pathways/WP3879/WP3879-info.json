    "description": "This pathway is modeled after Figure 7 in the article ''Upstream molecular signaling pathways of p27(Kip1) expression: effects of 4-hydroxytamoxifen, dexamethasone, and retinoic acids'' (See Bibliography). Several anticancer agents up-regulate expression of p27, a cyclin-dpendent kinase inhibitor that blocks the transition from G1 to S phase. The pathways used by the anticancer agents (retinoic acids, 4-hydroxytamoxifen, dexamethasone) are shown above from human breast cancer cells.",
