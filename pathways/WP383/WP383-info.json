    "description": "Muscle contraction is the process where muscle tissue is activated by a signal from the nervous system. In the case of voluntary action, the nervous signals are initiated from the brain by so-called action potentials. With reflexes, these potentials are coming directly from the spinal cord. Striated muscles are a group of muscles also called skeletal and cardiac muscle tissue.   Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP383).",
