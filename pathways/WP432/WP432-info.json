    "description": "Like many other amino acids, asparagine may be utilized by S. cerevisiae as a sole source of nitrogen. Catabolism of asparagine for nitrogen involves the action of asparaginases, which hydrolyze the amide group in the side chain of asparagine. This converts asparagine to aspartate and releases an assimilable molecule of ammonia (NH\u2083). Further nitrogen can be derived from the newly generated aspartate molecule via its reversible conversion to glutamate by aspartate aminotransferases. Glutamate, whose amino group can be hydrolyzed to release ammonia, represents one of the major sources of nitrogen for biosynthetic reactions in S. cerevisiae.
