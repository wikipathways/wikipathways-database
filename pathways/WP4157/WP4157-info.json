    "description": "Gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) is a naturally occurring neurotransmitter and a psychoactive drug. This compound is a precursor to GABA, glutamate, and glycine in certain brain areas, acts on the GHB receptor and is a weak agonist at the GABAB receptor. GHB has been used in a medical setting as a general anesthetic and as a treatment for cataplexy, narcolepsy, and alcoholism. It is also used illegally as an intoxicant, to try to increase athletic performance, and as a date rape drug. GHB is also produced as a result of fermentation, and is found in small quantities in some beers and wines, beef and small citrus fruits. Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency is a disease that causes GHB to accumulate in the blood.  Part of this pathway was inspired by Edition 5, Chapter 24 (Fig.24.2) of the book of Blau (ISBN 9783030677268) (Ed.4 Chapter 5, Fig. 5.3). ",
