    "description": "Protein pathways altered by mutations in adenoid cystic carcinoma. Pathways include epigentic modification, DNA damage checkpoint signals, MYB/MYC signalling pathway, FGF/IGF/PI3K signalling, and notch signalling. In the epigenetic modification pathway, several complexes promote the activity of HIST1H1E/HIST1H2AL which regulate chromatin remodeling. In the DNA damage pathway DNA damage in the nucleus signals to ATM and PRKDC to induce DNA repair and suspend the cell cycle. ATM further activates proteins that induce either apoptosis or DNA repair and leads to the activation of proteins that inhibit progression in the cell cycle. The MYB/MYC pathway involves the activation of protein complexes involved in inducing cell growth and proliferation by CREBBP and MYCBP. However this pathway has feedback inhibition by the binding of the MYBL1/MYB complex to NFIB which depresses MYB activity. The FGF/IGF/PI3K signalling pathway involves the activation of the FGFR4/INSRR complex by FGF16 and ERBB2 activation by ERBB2IP which leads to a signalling cascade that inhibits apoptosis and promotes cell growth and migration. The notch pathway is activated by the biding of CNTN6 to Notch leading to pathway activation. This pathway is regulated by RoxP2, CTBP1, and DTX4/FBXW7. These pathways are from figure 4 from Ho et al.   Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3651 CPTAC Assay Portal]",
