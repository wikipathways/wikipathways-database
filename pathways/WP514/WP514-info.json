    "description": "Histidine is synthesized from phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP), which is produced in the pentose phosphate pathway. The first step in the pathway is the condensation of PRPP and ATP by ATP-phosphoribosyl transferase (HIS1). HIS4 then hydrolyzes phosphoribosyl-ATP, which produces phosphoribosyl-AMP (PRAMP). Next, HIS4 catalyzes the formation of phosphoribosylformiminoAICAR-phosphate, which is converted to phosphoribulosylformimino-AICAR-P by the HIS6 gene product. HIS7 splits phosphoribulosylformimino-AICAR-P to form d-erythro-imidazole-glycerol-phosphate. HIS3 forms imidazole acetol-phosphate releasing water. HIS5 then makes l-histidinol-phosphate, which is hydrolyzed by HIS2 making histidinol. HIS4 catalyzes the oxidation of l-histidinol to form l-histidinal. In the last step, l-histidinal is converted to l-histidine.  Description adapted from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histidine).",
