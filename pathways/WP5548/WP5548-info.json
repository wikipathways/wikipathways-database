    "description": "This figure presents a comprehensive overview of molecular markers associated with neuroinflammation, specifically focusing on potential blood-based markers. Markers are organized by biological function and relevance to specific neuroimmune processes. The markers are grouped into seven categories, including systemic innate-immune mediators; blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) disruption and vascular endothelial injury; glial activation, which is subdivided into astrocyte and microglial activation; neuromodulators and neuropeptides; neuronal injury markers; the neurotoxic metabolite quinolinic acid, a neuroactive product of the kynurenine pathway; and neurotrophic factors.",
