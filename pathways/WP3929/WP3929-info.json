    "description": "Chemokines are small  cytokines, or signaling proteins, secreted by cells. A major rol of chemokines is to act as chemoattractants in guiding migration of cells. Chemokine signals are transduced by G-protein coupled receptors, which dissociate to activate diverse downstream pathways resulting in cellular polarization and actin reorganization.  This pathway was adapted from [KEGG](http://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?pathway:map04062).  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3929).",
