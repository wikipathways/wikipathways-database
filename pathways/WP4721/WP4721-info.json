    "description": "This pathway is inspired by the Lipidmaps>Eicosanoids Pathway expended pathway display [[1](https://lipidmaps.org/pathway/pathways_maps)]. Eicosanoids are a large group of compounds metabolised from arachidonic acid (AA), either via cyclooxygenases (COX) [[2](https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP4347)], lipooxygenases (LOX)[[3](https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP4348)], or cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYP) [[4](https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP4349)]. This pathway visualises the second route, via LOX. Green and orange boxes represent receptors, where the orange colour depicts peroxisome-proliferator activating receptors (PPARs) potentially activated by the eicosanoids.",
